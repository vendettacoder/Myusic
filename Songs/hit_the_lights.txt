no life till leather, we're gonna kick some ass tonight
we got the metal madness when our fans start screaming, it's right, well, alright, yeah
when we start to rock, we never want to stop again

hit the lights
hit the lights
hit the lights

we know our fans are insane, we're gonna blow this place away
with volume higher than anything today, the only way
when we start to rock, we never want to stop again

hit the lights
hit the lights
hit the lights

with all our screaming, we're gonna rip right through your brain
we got the lethal power, it's causing you sweet pain, oh, sweet pain, yeah
when we start to rock, we never want to stop again

hit the lights
hit the lights
hit the lights
hit them lights
