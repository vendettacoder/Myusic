wound up drunk again on robson street
strange cuz we always agreed
at the start of every evening
that's the last place i wanna be

coffee drinkers dressed in black with no sugar
they don't give me no respect
they say 'look here comes another one'
and i don't know what they mean yet

chorus

and i say
keep it light enough to travel...
don't let it all unravel...

promise me we won't go into the nightclub
i feel so fucked up when i'm in there
can't tell the bouncers from the customers
and i don't know which ones i prefer

promise me we won't go into the nightclub
i really think that it's obscene
what kind of people go to meet people
where they can't be heard or seen
