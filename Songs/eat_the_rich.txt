wake up kid, it's half past your youth
ain't nothin' really changin' but the date
you a grand slammer, but you no babe ruth
you gotta learn how to relate
or you'll be swingin' from the pearly gate
ah, got all the answers, lo' and behold
you got the right key baby but the wrong key hole, yo

well i woke up this morning
on the wrong side of the bed
and how i got to thinkin'
about all those things you said
about ordinary people
and how they make you sick
and if callin' names kicks back on you
then i hope this does the trick

'cause i'm sick of your complainin'
about how many bills
and i'm sick of all your bitchin'
'bout your poodles and your pills
and i just can't see no humor
about your way of life
and i think i can do more for you
with this here fork and knife

eat the rich
there's only one thing that they're good for
eat the rich
take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich
i gotta get this off my chest
eat the rich
take one bite now, spit out the rest

so i called up my head shrinker
and told him what i done
he said, "you best go on a diet"
yeah i hope you have some fun
and a don't go burst a bubble
on rich folk who get rude
'cause you won't get in no trouble
when you eats that kind of food

now they're smoking up their junk bonds
and then they go get stiff
and they're dancing at the yacht club
with muff and uncle biff
but there's one good thing that happens
when you toss your pearls to swine
their attitudes may taste like shit
but go real good with wine

eat the rich
there's only one thing that they're good for
eat the rich
take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich
i gotta get this off my chest
eat the rich
take one bite now, spit out the rest

believe in all the good things
that money just can't buy
then you won't get no bellyache
from eatin' humble pie
i believe in rags to riches
your inheritance won't last
so take your grey poupon my friend
and shove it up your ass

eat the rich
there's only one thing that they're good for
eat the rich
take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich
i gotta get this off my chest
eat the rich
take one bite now, spit out the rest

eat the rich
there's only one thing that they're good for
eat the rich
take one bite now, come back for more
eat the rich
don't stop me now i'm goin' crazy
eat the rich
that's my idea of a good time baby
