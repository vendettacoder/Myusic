this one knows she comes and goes
and when she goes she goes
this one knows she comes and goes
and when she goes she goes

sproston green she used to pace me
and now she hasn't got the time
i know i'm too necessary
and everything she stole was mine

this one knows she comes and goes
and when she goes she goes
this one knows she comes and goes
and when she goes she goes

sproston green she used to pace me
and now she hasn't got the time
i know i'm too necessary
and everything she stole was mine

you've got this one
i've got no one
she's oh she's part of something wrong

oooh...
