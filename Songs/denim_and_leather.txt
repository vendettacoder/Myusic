where were you in '79 when the dam began to burst
did you check us out down at the local show
were you wearing denim, wearing leather
did you run down to the front
did you queue for your ticket through the ice and snow

denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free

did you read the music paper from the back and to the front
did you find out where to see your favorite band
did you listen to the radio every friday night
did hang around your local record store

denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free

do you dream of playing guitar or smashing up the drums
maybe you can learn to play the bass
you can always be a singer like me and front the band
when on the stage we wait at your command

denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free

it was you - that set the spirit free
it was you - that put us here today
it was you - that filled the concert halls
it was you - that set the spirit free

denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
