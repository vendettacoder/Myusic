chewin' out a rhythm on my bubble gum
the sun is out and i want some
it's not hard, not far to reach
we can hitch a ride
to rockaway beach
up on the roof, out on the street
down in the playground, the hot concrete
bus ride is too slow
they blast out the disco on the radio

rock, rock, rockaway beach
rock, rock, rockaway beach
rock, rock, rockaway beach
we can hitch a ride
to rockaway beach

rock, rock, rockaway beach
rock, rock, rockaway beach
rock, rock, rockaway beach
we can hitch a ride
to rockaway beach

it's not hard, not far to reach
we can hitch a ride
to rockaway beach
