got brass in pocket
got bottle, i'm gonna use it

gonna make you, make you, make you notice

got motion restrained emotion

no reason just seems so pleasing
gonna make you, make you, make you notice

gonna use my arms
gonna use my legs
gonna use my style
gonna use my sidestep
gonna use my fingers
gonna use my, my, my imagination

'cause i'm gonna make you see
there's nobody else here
no one like me

i gotta have some of your attention
give it to me

gonna make you, make you, make you notice

gonna use my arms
gonna use my legs
gonna use my style
gonna use my sidestep
gonna use my fingers
gonna use my, my, my imagination

'cause i gonna make you see
there's nobody else here
no one like me
i'm special (special), so special (special)
i gotta have some of your attention
give it to me

'cause i gonna make you see
there's nobody else here
no one like me
i'm special (special), so special (special)
i gotta have some of your attention
give it to me
