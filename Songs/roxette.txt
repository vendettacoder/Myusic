(wilko johnson)

i saw you out the other night
i saw somebody hold you tight
roxette, i wonder who it could be
it was so dark i couldn't see
but i know it wasn't me
when i tell you it ain't right
i know you've got to agree

i followed you into a show
the band was playing rock'n'roll
roxette, i didn't need to seek you out
the music played so loud
that i could hear you through the crowd
you was telling everyone
about a new guy you'd found

roxette i gotta go away
and leave you for a couple of days
roxette, i don't want no more of your tricks
i'm gonna get some concrete mix
and fill your back door up with bricks
and you better be there waiting
when i get my business fixed
