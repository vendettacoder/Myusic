without a guide, without a hand
unwed virgins in the land
unwed virgins in the land tied up on the sand
when there come ships into the land
they'll be awaiting reverence
they'll be awaiting reverence at their children's hands
are you not loyal to your pride? are you not on the secret side?
it's not a crime, a gain to you
do you not understand?
