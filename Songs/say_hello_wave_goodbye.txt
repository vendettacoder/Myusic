standing in the door of the pink flamingo
crying in the rain
it was a kind of so so love
and i'm going to make sure it never

happens again
you and i
it had to be
the standing joke of the year

you were a sleep around
a lost and found
and not for me i fear
i tried to make it work

you in a cocktail skirt
and me in a suit
(well it just wasn't me)
you're used to wearing less

and now you're life's a mess
so insecure you see
i put up with all the scenes
and this is one scene

that's going to be played my way
take your hands off me
i don't belong to you, you see
take a look at my face

for the last time
i never knew you
you never knew me
say hello goodbye

say hello wave goodbye
under the deep red light
i can see the makeup sliding down
hey little girl you will always make up

so take off that unbecoming frown
what about me - well
i'll find someone
that's not going cheap in the sales

a nice little housewife
who'll give me a steady life
and won't keep going off the rails
take your hands off me

i don't belong to you, you see
take a look at my face
for the last time
i never knew you

you never knew me
say hello goodbye
say hello wave goodbye
we've been involved

for quite a while now
and to keep you secret has been hell
we're strangers meeting for the first time o.k.?
just smile and say hello

say hello then wave goodbye
goodbye
