3,5,0,1,2,5, go!

i was there in the back stage
when first light came around
i grew up like a changeling
to win the first time around
i can see all the weakness
i can pick all the faults
well, i concede all the faith tests
just to stick in your throats
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g

i hung around in your soundtrack
to mirror all that you've done
to find the right side of reason
to kill the three lies for one
i can see all the cold facts
i can see through your eyes
all this talk made no contact
no matter how hard we tried
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g

i can still hear the footsteps
i can only see walls
i slid into your man-traps
with no hearing at all
i just see contradiction
had to give up the fight
just to live in the past tense
to make believe you were right
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g
