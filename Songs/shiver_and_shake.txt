you're just a waste of time
you're just a babbling face
you're just three sick holes that run like sores
you're a fucking waste

you're like a slug on the floor
oh you're useless and ugly and useless and ugly
and i shiver and shake
when i think of how you make me hate

i want to smash you to pieces
i want to smash you up and screaming
i want to smash you helpless down on the floor
smash you until you're not here anymore

yeah i shiver and shake

i shiver and shake
