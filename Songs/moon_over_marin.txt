the crowded future stings my eyes, i still find time to exercise
in uniform with two white stripes
unlock my section of the sand, it's fenced off to the water's edge
i clamp a gas mask on my head

on my beach at night
bathe in my moonlight

another tanker's hit the rocks, abandoned to spill out its guts
the sand is laced with sticky glops
oh, shimmering moonlight sheen upon the waves and water clogged with oil
white gases steam up from the soil

on my beach at night
bathe in my moonlight

i squash dead fish between my toes, try not to step on any bones
i turn around and i go home
i slip back through my basement door, switch off all that i own below
dive in my scalding wooden tub

my own beach at night
bathe in my moonlight
there will always be a moon over marin
