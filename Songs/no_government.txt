no government is a way of life.
no government means to trust your friends.
i know who i am and you know who you are.

if everybody knew what they wanted,
there'd be nothing, nothing left.
people would do what they wanted,
and there'd be no government.

there'd be no government,
there'd be no government.
people would do what they wanted,
and there'd be no government.

there'd be no government,
there'd be no government.
people would do what they wanted,
and there'd be no government.

life has me tempting, refreshing me,
making me stretch.
my body is flowing and happy
and feeling refreshed.

my choices, believe me, are infinite easy.
exciting and mystical choices before me.
they tell me my life is a journey in no government.

if everybody lived in their bodies,
we'd have so much, so much time.
touching would be such a pass-time, 
and we'd have such lazy days.

we'd have such lazy days, 
for we'd kiss them away.
people would worship eachother,
and we'd have loose, lazy ways.

no government is an easy time.
no government is an exciting life.
we'd work for ourselves,
and we'd love for ourselves, 
and for no government.

there'd be no suffering.
there'd be no government.
people would see and let them be, 
and we'd have no government.

there'd be no government,
there'd be no government.
people will see and let them be,
and will be no government.

no government is a way of life. (7x)
