this is the definition of my life 
lying in bed in the sunrise 
choking on a vitamin tablet the doctor gave 
in the hope of saving me 
in the hope of saving me 

mott's in the corner of the room 
junkyard fool with eyes of (glue/gloom/blue) 
i asked him time again, 

take me in and dry the rain 
take me in and dry the rain 
take me in and dry the rain, 
take me in and dry the rain, 
the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, my rain now 

dusty brown boots in the corner by the ironing board 
spray-on dust is the greatest thing 
sure is the greatest thing 
since the last, since the last

if there's something inside that you wanna say 
say it out loud it'll be okay 
i will be alright, i will be alright 
i will be your light, i will be your light
