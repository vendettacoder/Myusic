look at the stars 
look how they shine for you
and everything you do 
yeah, they were all yellow

i came along
i wrote a song for you 
and all the things you do
and it was called "yellow"

so, then, i took my turn
oh, what a thing to've done
and it was all yellow

your skin 
oh, yeah, your skin and bones
turn it into something beautiful
d'you know
you know i love you so 
you know i love you so

i swam across 
i jumped across for you
oh, what a thing to do 
'cause you were all yellow

i drew a line
i drew a line for you
oh, what a thing to do
and it was all yellow

your skin 
oh, yeah, your skin and bones
turn into something beautiful
d'you know 
for you, i'd bleed myself dry
for you, i'd bleed myself dry

it's true 
look how they shine for you
look how they shine for you
look how they shine for
look how they shine for you 
look how they shine for you
look how they shine 

look at the stars
look how they shine for you
and all the things that you do
