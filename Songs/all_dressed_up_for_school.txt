well she first caught my eye a runnin' round in shorts
but she never bothered with her hair
just a barefooted chick with all skinned up knees
yeah she didn't care what she'd wear
(all dressed up for school)

dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
all dressed up for school

all summer long she had a crush on me
but i just couldn't care at all
but new to school threads really did it for me
yeah she's turned into a doll
(all dressed up for school)

dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
all dressed up for school
weah

goes out every night 'cause she's a sharp little doll
and the guys can't leave her alone
now she hardly finds the time to talk to me
she's not the little girl i've always known

dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
all dressed up for school
