our own correspondent is sorry to tell
of an uneasy time that all is not well

on the borders, there's movement
in the hills, there is trouble
food is short, crime is double

prices have risen since the government fell
casualties increase as the enemy shell
the climate's unhealthy, flies and rats thrive
and sooner or later, the end will arrive

this is your correspondent 
running out of tape
gunfire's increasing

looting, burning
rape

rape, rape
rape, rape
