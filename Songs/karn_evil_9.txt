1st impression part one

cold and misty morning, i heard a warning borne in the air
about an age of power where no one had an hour to spare,
where the seeds have withered, silent children shivered, in the cold
now their faces captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold
i'll be there
i'll be there
i will be there

suffering in silence, they've all been betrayed
they hurt them and they beat them, in a terrible way
praying for survival at the end of the day
there is no compassion for those who stay
i'll be there
i'll be there
i will be there

there must be someone who can set them free
to take their sorrow from this odyssey
to help the helpless and the refugee
to protect what's left of humanity
can't you see
can't you see
can't you see

i'll be there
i'll be there
i will be there

to heal their sorrow
to beg and borrow
fight tomorrow

step inside! hello! we've a most amazing show
you'll enjoy it all we know
step inside! step inside!

we've got thrills and shocks, supersonic fighting cocks
leave your hammers at the box
come inside! come inside!

roll up! roll up! roll up!
see the show!

left behind the bars, rows of bishops' heads in jars
and a bomb inside a car
spectacular! spectacular!

if you follow me there's a speciality
some tears for you to see
misery, misery,

roll up! roll up! roll up!
see the show!

next upon the bill in our house of vaudeville
we've a stripper in a till
what a thrill! what a thrill!

and not content with that,
with our hands behind our backs,
we pull jesus from a hat,
get into that! get into that!

roll up! roll up! roll up!
see the show!


1st impression part two

welcome back my friends to the show that never ends
we're so glad you could attend, come inside, come inside
there behind the glass stands a real blade of grass
be careful as you pass, move along, move along

come inside, the show's about to start
guaranteed to blow your head apart
rest assured you'll get your money's worth
greatest show in heaven, hell or earth
you've got to see the show, it's a dynamo
you've got to see the show, it's rock and roll, oh

right before your eyes we pull laughter from the skies
and he laughs until he cries, then he dies, then he dies

come inside, the show's about to start
guaranteed to blow your head apart
you've got to see the show, it's a dynamo
you've got to see the show, it's rock and roll, oh

soon the gypsy queen in a glaze of vaseline
will perform on guillotine, what a scene, what a scene
next upon the stand will you please extend a hand
to alexander's ragtime band, dixieland, dixieland

roll up, roll up, roll up
see the show

performing on a stool we've a sight to make you drool
seven virgins and a mule, keep it cool, keep it cool
we would like it to be known the exhibits that were shown
were exclusively our own, all our own, all our own

come and see the show, come and see the show
come and see the show
see the show

3rd impression

man alone, born of stone,
will stamp the dust of time
his hands strike the flame of his soul
ties a rope to a tree and hangs the universe
until the winds of laughter blows cold

fear that rattles in men's ears
and rears its hideous head
dread .... death .... in the wind ....

man of steel, pray and kneel
with fever's blazing torch
thrust into the face of the night
draws a blade of compassion
kissed by countless kings
whose jewelled trumpet words blind his sight

walls that no man thought would fall
the altars of the just
crushed .... dust .... in the wind ....

no man yields who flies in my ship
danger!
let the bridge computer speak
stranger!
load your program. i am yourself

no computer stands in my way
only blood can cancel my pain
guardians of a new clear dawn
let the maps of war be drawn

rejoice! glory is ours!
our young men have not died in vain,
their graves need no flowers
the tapes have recorded their names

i am all there is
negative! primitive! limited! i let you live!
but i gave you life
what else could you do?
to do what was right
i'm perfect! are you?
