time stands still, all i can feel is the time standing still
as you put down the keys and say 'don't call me please', while the radio plays
"i think i need a new heart", oh
"i think i need a new heart", oh

you've lied, too, but it's a sin that i can't tell the truth
cause it all comes out wrong unless i put it in a song, so the radio plays
"i think i need a new heart", just for you
"i think i need a new heart"

cause i always say "i love you", when i mean "turn out the light"
and i say "let's run away", when i just mean "stay the night"
but the words you want to hear, you will never hear from me
i'll never say "happy anniversary"; never stay to say "happy anniversary"

so i think i need a new heart, oh
i think i need a new heart, oh
i think i need a new heart, oh
i think i need a new heart, oh
give me time
