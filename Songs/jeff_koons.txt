he has come to bring you things that make you happy
a gigantic puppy made of living flowers
a balloon dog like a helium brancusi
baroque and rococo, louis quattorze

basketballs suspended in bavaria
usher in a fat contented pig
whose every hair is hand-carved by italian master-craftsmen
a porcelain michael jackson and bubbles in a wig

a box of breakfast cereal we market to the morning
a teddy bear policeman reprimands you with a warning
and all that's made in heaven falls apart
pink and yellow arrows through your heart
blue and yellow arrows through your heart
green and yellow arrows through your heart

mr koons with a swordfish!
pin the tail on koons!
president koons on mount rushmore!
the klondike trail by donkey
context is a game that you can play
and art can help you have a better day

pink panthers from the realm of the ephemeral
a friendly advertising testimonial
a second empire chair, boticelli hair
cut-outs at a fun fair and the clothes you love to wear

every time that it appears that happiness and fun
are as far away as jupiter and mars
according to the lore of great philosophers
a shaman must appear amongst the stars
a sun king lifts his hand amongst the stars
and a vacuum cleaner stands amongst the stars

gigantic baboons
cereal spoons
philosopher kings
the moon in june
disney cartoons
the morning sun
jeff koons
