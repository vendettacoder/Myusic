however you feel, whatever it takes
whenever it's real, whatever awaits
whatever you need, however so slight
whenever it's real, whenever it's right

i've been thinking long and hard about the things you said to me
like a bitter stranger
now i see the long, the short, the middle, and what's in between

i could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
you're a bitter stranger (pull me out)

whatever you feel, whatever it takes
whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
whatever you need, however so slight
wherever it leads, whenever it's right

honey, i'm a prize and you're a catch, and we're a perfect match
like two bitter strangers
now i see the long and short of it, and i can make it last

i could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
you're a bitter stranger (pull me out)
i could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
you're a bitter stranger (pull me out)

i see the sunshine in your eyes
i'll try the things you'll never try
i'll be the one that leaves you high, high, high
