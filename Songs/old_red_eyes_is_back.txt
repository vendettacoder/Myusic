old red eyes is back 
red from the night before the night before 
walked into the wrong bar walked into a door 

old red's in town 
and sitting late at night he doesn't make a sound 
just adding to the wrinkles on his deathly frown 

they're only red from all the tears that i should've shed 
they're only red from all the women that i could've wed 
so when you look into these eyes i hope you realise 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 

listen up old red 
you never listened to a word the doctor said 
he told you if you drank another you'd be dead 

old red eyes is back 
his shoulders ache all over and his brain is sore 
he pours a drink and listens to his body thaw 

they're only red from all the thoughts unused inside my head 
they're only red from all the things i could have done instead 
so when you look into these eyes i hope you realise 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 

blue is a street without an end 
red is the colour of my hell 
blue is a greeting from a friend 
red is the colour of farewell 

old red he died 
and every single landlord in the district cried 
an empty bottle of whisky laying by his side 
a lazy little tear running from each eye 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue 
they could never be blue
