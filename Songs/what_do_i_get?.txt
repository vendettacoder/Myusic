i just want a lover like any other, what do i get?
i only want a friend who will stay to the end, what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?

i'm in distress, i need a caress, what do i get?
i'm not on the make i just need a break, what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?

i only get sleepless nights
alone here in my half-empty bed
for you things seem to turn out right
i wish they'd only happen to me instead

what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
oh

i only get sleepless nights
alone here in my half-empty bed
for you things seem to turn out right
i wish they'd only happen to me instead

what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?

i just want a lover like any other, what do i get?
i only want a friend who will love to the end, what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
what do i get? oh oh what do i get?
well let me tell you now
(what do i get?)
(what do i get?)
(what do i get?) i get no love
(what do i get?) i get no sleep at nights
(what do i get?) i get nothing that's nice
(what do i get?) i get nothing at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
'cause i don't get you
