moving at the speed of sound
you'd think i'd be slowing down
but i'm not losing my momentum
there are ways to turn around
so i don't crash into the ground
i wish someone would invent them

despite the pretty dress and curls
you don't throw like other girls
you follow through

but i'll come on back
cause i know
though you meant to let me go
i could always be your boomerang

i'll come on back
you will see
that all you said got through to me
and i would like to be your boomerang

going down but no one knew
i was losing altitude
should have landed and i tried to
i never took my eyes off you
but i got dizzy and you
threw me you were right to

but i'll come on back
cause i know
though you meant to let me go
i could always be your boomerang

i'll come on back
you will see
that all you said got through to me
and i would like to be your boomerang

i flew apart but they reattached me
i'm coming in hot, hope you'll catch me

i'll come on back
cause i know
though you meant to let me go
i could always be your boomerang

i'll come on back
you will see
that all you said got through to me
and i would like to be your boomerang

i'll come on back
cause i know
though you meant to let me go
i could always be your boomerang

i'll come on back
you will see
that all you said got through to me
and i would like to be your boomerang

yeah, i would like to be your boomerang
let me be your boomerang
i would like to be your boomerang
