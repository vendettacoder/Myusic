i am a one in ten a number on a list,
i am a one in ten even though i don't exist.
nobody knows me, but im always there,
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care

my arms enfold the dole queue,
malnutrition dulls my hair,
my eyes are black and lifeless
with an underprivileged stare
i'm the beggar on the corner
will no-one spare a dime
i'm the child that never learns to read
because no one spared the time.

i am a one in ten a number on a list,
i am a one in ten even though i don't exist.
nobody knows me, but im always there,
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care

i'm the murderer and the victim
the licence with the gun
i'm a sad and bruised old lady
in an ally in a slum
i'm a middle aged businessman
with chronic heart disease
i'm another teenage suicide
in a street that has no trees

i am a one in ten a number on a list,
i am a one in ten even though i don't exist.
nobody knows me, but im always there,
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care

i'm a starving third world mother
a refugee without a home
i'm a house wife hooked on valium
i'm a pensioner alone
i'm a cancer ridden spectre
covering the earth
i'm another hungry baby
i'm an accident of birth.

i am a one in ten a number on a list,
i am a one in ten even though i don't exist.
nobody knows me, but im always there,
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care
