strolling along, minding my own business
well there goes a girl and a half
she's got me going up and down
she's got me going up and down

walking on the beaches, looking at the peaches
well i got the notion girl
that you got some suntan lotion
in that bottle of yours

spread it all over my peelin' skin baby
that feels really good
all this skirt lappin' up the sun
lap me up
why don't you come on and
lap me up

walking on the beaches, looking at the peaches
well i got the notion girl
that you got some suntan lotion
in that bottle of yours

well there goes another one
just lying down on the sand dunes
i'd better go take a swim
and see if i can cool down a little bit

coz you and me woman
we got a lotta things on our minds
(you know what i mean)

walking on the beaches, looking at the peaches
will you just take a look over there (where?) there
is she tryin' to get outta that clitares?
liberation for women, that's what i preach
(preacher man)

walking on the beaches, looking at the peaches
oh shit, there goes the charabang
looks like i am gonna be stuck here the whole summer
well, what a bummer

i can think of a lot worse places to be
like down in the streets
or down in the sewer
or even on the end of a skewer

down on the beaches, just looking at the peaches
down on the beaches, just looking at the peaches
down on the beaches, just looking at the sunglasses
down on the beaches, just looking at the peaches
down on the beaches, just looking at the peaches
down on the beaches, just looking at the peaches
down on the beaches
