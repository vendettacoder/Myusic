i stopped talking when i was six years old 
i didn't want anything more to do with the outside world 
i was happy being quiet 
but of course they wouldn't leave me alone 
my parents tried every trick in the book 
from speech therapists to child psychologists 
they even tried bribery 
i could have anything, as long as i said it out loud 

life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 
life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 

of course this episode didn't last forever 
i'd made my point and it was time to move on 
to peel away the next layer of deceit 
and see what new surprises lay in store 
my school report said i showed no interest 
'a disruptive influence' i felt sorry for them in a way 
and when they finally expelled me 
it didn't mean a thing 

life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 
life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 

("at that time she stopped what she was doing, she stopped playing... she stared, she had the 
facial grimicing... and then the psychiatrist was saying, "julie, julie, can you hear me? can you 
open your eyes? can you stick out your tongue?" and all of a sudden, julie struck out") 

the november day i came home the christmas decorations were already up 
spray on snow, coloured flashing lights 
and an artificial tree that played silent night 
over and over again 
my parents welcomed me with loving arms 
but within an hour were back at each others throats 
normal, happy childhood back on course 
batteries not included 

life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 
life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 
life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it 
life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it
