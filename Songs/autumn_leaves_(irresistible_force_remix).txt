autumn leaves fall and are swept out of sight,
the words that you said have come true.
autumn leaves fall and are swept out of sight,
so is the memory of love that we knew.

the wind of forgetfullness blows them
into the night of regret.
the song we so often did sing,
is echoing echoing yet.

the falling leaves,
drift by the window.
the autumn leaves of red and gold.
i see your lips,
the summer kisses,
the sunburned hands i used to hold.

since you went away,
the days grow long,
and soon i'll hear cold winter song.
but i miss you most of all, my darling,
when autumn leaves start to fall.
