peeling the skin back from my eyes, i felt surprised
that the time on the clock was the time i usually retired
to the place where i cleared my head of you;
but just for today, i think i'll lie here and dream of you.

i've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in,
but if the sweat pours out, just shout i'll try to swim and pull you out.

a howling wind blows the litter as the rain flows,
as street lamps pour orange colored shapes through your window,
a broken soul stares from a pair of watering eyes,
uncertain emotions force an uncertain smile...

i've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in,
but if the sweat pours out, just shout i'll try to swim and pull you out.
