i feel depressed, i feel so bad
'cause you're the best girl that i've ever had
i can't get your love, i can't get a fraction
oh, little girl, psychotic reaction
and it feels like this

i feel so lonely night and day
i can't get your love, i must stay away
well, i need you, girl, by my side
oh, little girl, would you like to take a ride now?
i can't get your love, i can't get satisfaction
oh, little girl, psychotic reaction
