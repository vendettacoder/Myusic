while investigating a cows placenta
a lab technician stumbles and activates a
dna-mutating virus
dna-mutating virus from hell

which causes his body to transform grotesquely
into a plasmic knot with a widow's peak and dissolving skin
but not before he goes slowly insane
not before he dies slowly in pain

and unfortunately he spreads the disease to his
unsuspecting friends and neighbors causing a calamity
of world dimensions as the plague spreads
world dimensions as the plague spreads

and because human beings are cruel and barbaric 
vigilante committees form which persecute the infected
the earth becomes a bloodbath hell
the earth becomes a bloody hell

until someway somehow a nuclear holocaust is cast
causing every single form of life on the planet to die
