i attended stanley tech
in south norwood hill
i think it was, oh yeah
where the bronze bust was nicked
let me think, it must've been in my third year
lying in wait outside virgo fidelis
and the lady edridge grammar school
i worked at the fairfield halls
cleaning toilets, but i understood some day
i'd be back in my own right
giving concerts in my own peculiar way
but i kept my rabbit back at home
and i cleaned it every other day
(other day, other day, other day)
and now the time has come to say
farewell dad with your sardines
and the tv set that i blew
and now the time has come to say
farewell mum to your baked beans
and the poppadums i never knew

i'll be in los angeles
where the famous people never quite get old
yeah, in los angeles
where they're all to rich to even feel the cold
but i'll still be dreaming of you croydon
especially in the cold and rain
(cold and rain, cold and rain, cold and rain)
and now the time has come to say
i'll be leaving croydon way
to the lovely town i once knew
and now the time has come to say
i'll be back another day
saying sod la, what a day
what a day
what a day
what a day
what a day
