culture sucks down words
itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
organise your safe tribal war
hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto

each day living out a lie
life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

life lies a slow suicide
orthodox dreams and symbolic myths
from feudal serf to spender
this wonderful world of purchase power

just like lungs sucking on air
survival's natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

all we want from you are the kicks you've given us
all we want from you are the kicks you've given us
all we want from you are the kicks you've given us
all we want from you are the kicks you've given us

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

drive away and it's the same
everywhere death row, everyone's a victim
your joys are counterfeit
this happiness corrupt political shit

living life like a comatose
ego loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness
