the odd boy lay down by the football field
took out a slim volume of mallarme
the centre-forward called him an imbecile
it's an odd boy who doesn't like sport
sport, sport, masculine sport
equips a young man for society,
yes, sport turns out a jolly good sort
it's an odd boy who doesn't like sport

by the haystacks hot with thighs
thru' the thickets thick with eyes
although we didn't mean to, we are on the road to keynsham
