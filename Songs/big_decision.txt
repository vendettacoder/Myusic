see my honey in the streets
it's desolate but where she likes to meet
economies gets weaker
reactionaries stronger
as they get satisfaction on their knees

you rather sail the ocean
than make
a big
decision

i won't function anymore
plastic bullets shoot headlines in store
business men get richer
individual stronger
bells won't ring when scum boot down the door

you rather sail the ocean
than make
a big
decision

what you've gotta do
in this day and age
you gotta agitate
educate
organize
take the time to live
take the time to give
you gotta agitate
educate
organize

see my honey in the street
it's desolate but where she likes to meet
i'd like to keep her
make her even sweeter
for anyone who cares to be with me

you rather sail the ocean
than make
a big
decision

you rather sail the ocean
than make
a big
decision

what you've gotta do
in this day and age
you gotta agitate
educate
organize
take the time to live
take the time to give
you gotta agitate
educate
organize
