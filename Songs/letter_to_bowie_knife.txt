everyday on my way home 
the clouds would break and the angels 
would sing their refrain 

this world's an ungodly place 
strangled by vines unchaste 
so with my shining blade of steel 
i would cut a path wide 

dipped in the ink of the fight 
written clean through the night 
mark my words upon the front page 
to set my world straight 

it's too late, it's too late 
it's too late, it's too late 
just like i found it, my world is split 
right down the spine 

years bled dry now ripe for a reckoning 
my blade's back slash beckoning 
slice my wounds and i make the sign one more time 

come on. come on. come home. come home 
yeah it's too late, it's too late 
it's too late, to refrain...refrain...refrain... 

did those angels ever sing? 
sliced my world in two
