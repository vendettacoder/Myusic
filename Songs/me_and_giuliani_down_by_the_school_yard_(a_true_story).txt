well, the way i see it, it doesn't really matter
because it don't make no sense to all those mad manhatters
but i do believe that there must come a moment
when even the piggiest pig must get on up and move it
i got this friend named neil, swears nixon had a soul
but what i'd like to know is can giuli do the stroll?

people always ask me, "what's so fucking great about dancing, dancing?"
how the fuck should i know? yeah, even i can barely understand it, understand it
but when the music takes over
the music takes control

here's a message to you, rudy and you, sir, mr. bloomberg
and the rest of you ties-too-tight dudes
y'all could learn a lesson by losing inhibitions, yeah
lose yourself in the music, lose yourself in the moment
because we have nothing more than this very second
you can't count on the one coming after, no one's sure about the one before
so forget about it, we live here and now, dude
here and now, here and now, here and now, so get on down

nyc is where the freaks come to be free
and if i can't get my freak on see
i'm a hang up giuliani, he can sick his lackeys on me
but you can't stop a new age dawning

yeah, so if you got hips then shake 'em
and if you got fears forsake 'em
giuliani's got his rules but we ain't no fools
let's break 'em

yeah, so if you got hips then shake 'em
and if you got fears forsake 'em
giuliani's got his rules but we ain't no fools
let's break 'em

let's, let's, let's break 'em, let's break 'em down
and on the way, we'll make them say

everybody cut, everybody cut
everybody cut, footloose
everybody cut, everybody cut
everybody cut, footloose

now break 'em
and shake that butt
and on the way, we'll make 'em say
