i am that, thou art that, and all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
this is that

oooo

daybreak and i take a glide
into the pool of peace inside
(two waves travel by)
to waves and i both travel by
(and that makes all the difference to me)

life supporting waves of bliss
mother divine's precious kiss
brings with love the light of wisdom
and the gift of eternal freedom

to waves and i both travel by
(... and the nature of man...)
and that makes all the difference to me
(krishna...)

all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
this is that
this is that

dusk time the shadows fall
into the timeless time of all

to waves and i both travel by

golden auras glow around you
omnipresent love surrounds you
wisdom warming as the sun
you and i are truly one

to waves and i both travel by
and that makes all the difference to me

i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
