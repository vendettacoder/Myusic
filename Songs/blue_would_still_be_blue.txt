it's not raining cats, it's not raining dogs
and pigs are not flying, or turning the cogs
the sun has no hat on, whenever it shines
and i've never seen a cat with nine lives
i'm not in a film, this isn't a play
i saw no aliens landing today
i just saw you, and thought of me

'cause if i had you
all the stars wouldn't fall from the sky
and the moon wouldn't start to cry
there'd be no earthquakes
i'd still make mistakes

but if i had you
well, there'd still be day and night
and i'd still do wrong and right
oh, blue would still be blue
but things would be easier with you

and this is no palace, the place that i live
and i am no king, but i've got things to give
and i waste so much time, thinking about time
and i should be out there, claiming what's mine
'cause any day i could die, just like i was born
and this bit in the middle is what i'm here for
and i just want to fill it all with joy

'cause if i had you
all the stars wouldn't fall from the sky
and the moon wouldn't start to cry
there'd be no earthquakes
i'd still make mistakes

but if i had you
well, there'd still be night and day
and we'd all still have to pay
oh, blue would still be blue
but things would be easier with you
