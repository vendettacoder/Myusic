your outside is in
your outside is in
your inside is out

so come on
come on is such a joy
come on is such a joy
come on and take it easy
come on and make it easy

everybody's got something to hide
except for me and my monkey

the higher you fly
the deeper you go
the deeper you go
the higher you fly

so come on
come on
come on it's such a joy
come on it's such a joy
come on, let's take it easy
come on and make it easy

everybody's got something to hide
except for me and my monkey

your inside is out
your outside is in
your outside is in
your inside is out

so come on
come on
come on it's such a joy
come on it's such a joy
come on, let's make it easy
come on and make it easy
take it easy

everybody's got something to hide
except for me and my monkey
