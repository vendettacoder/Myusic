see that boy just standing over there
he stopped me today said he liked my hair.... ooh 
he asked me where you going tonight....
(err) and i said i'm with my girls... (yea is that all right?) 
to tell you the truth he was just a lil bit........ fresh 
he said he liked the way i put my lipstick.... on 
he said how many sugars do you like in your tea? (umm) 
i said forget about the sugar have a spoonful of me, cuz i taste so sweet 

[chorus]
oh my gosh he's making eyes at me and i don't mind at all 
oh my gosh he's making my imagination run w-wild 

listen to this yea

no cares in the world didn't have a plan 
i turned around and i caught his eye 
he made me lose my concentration 

did you get his number? no 
did you get his name? ummm 
what score would you give him on a scale of 1 to 10? 
i didn't get his number. (i didn't get his number)
