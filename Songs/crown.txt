who's gonna be my savior
now that i've learned to believe?
who's gonna be the answer
to all of my questioning?
well, i hope i'm not lost
but i think that hope is now distancing
and the words that secure a cause
are now faint whisperings

who's gonna wear my crown?
who's gonna wear my crown?
i don't know, i just might alone
who's gonna wear my crown?
who's gonna wear my crown?
i don't know, i've just got to go my way

who's gonna be my partner
now that i stand here alone?
who's gonna be the shepherd
to lead this poor boy back home?
well, i hope i'm not lost
but i think that hope is now distancing
and the words that secure a cause
are now faint whisperings

who's gonna wear my crown?
who's gonna wear my crown?
i don't know, i just might alone
who's gonna wear my crown?
who's gonna wear my crown?
i don't know, i've just got to go my way

who's gonna wear my crown?
who's gonna wear my crown?
i don't know, i just might alone
who's gonna wear my crown?
who's gonna wear my crown?
i don't know, i've just got to go
