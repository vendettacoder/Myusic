when you wake up in the morning, and the light is hurt your head
the first thing you do when you get up out of bed
is hit the streets a-runnin' and try to beat the masses
and go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

spied a little thing, and i followed her all night
in a funky fine levi's, and her sweater's kind of tight
she had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molasses
but what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

now go out and get yourself some big black frames
with the glass so dark they won't even know your name
and the choice is up to you 'cause they come in two classes
rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
