i've been dreaming 
of the things i've learnt about a boy
who's bleeding, celebrate to elevate
the joy is not the same without the pain

ooh

ipso facto
using up your oxygen, you know i'm shallow
calling out for extra help
you've got to let me in or let me out

ooh, something to talk about
yeah, something to talk about

i've been dreaming 
of the things i've learnt about a boy
who's leaving nothing else to chance again
you've got to let me in or let me out

ooh, something to talk about
yeah, something to talk about
