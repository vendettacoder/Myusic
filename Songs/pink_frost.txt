i want to stop my crying
i want to stop my crying
but she's lying there dying
how can i live when you see what i've done?
how can i live when you see what i've done?
what can i do if she dies?
what can i do if she dies?
what can i do if she's lost?
just the thought fills my heart with pink frost
i thought i was dreaming -
so i didn't heed her screaming
i'm so scared
i'm so scared
she won't move and i'm holding her head
she won't move and i'm holding her head
she's lost...bye bye bye
she's lost...bye bye bye
she's lost...bye bye bye
pink frost...bye bye bye
i'm really not lying
i'm so scared
i'll have to stop my crying
now she's dead
what can i do if she dies?
what can i do if she dies?
what can i do if she's lost?
just the thought fills my heart with pink frost
(oh no!)
