and it sure been a cold, cold winter 
and the wind ain't been blowin' from the south 
it's sure been a cold, cold winter 
and a lotta love is all burned out 

it sure been a hard, hard winter 
my feet been draggin' 'cross the ground 
and i hope it's gonna be a long, hot summer 
and a lotta love will be burnin' bright 

and i wish i been out in california 
when the lights on all the christmas trees went out 
but i been burnin' my bell, book and candle 
and the restoration plays have all gone 'round 

it sure been a cold, cold winter 
my feet been draggin' 'cross the ground 
and the fields has all been brown and fallow 
and the springtime take a long way around 

yeah, and i wish i been out in stone canyon 
when the lights on all the christmas trees went out 
but i been burnin' my bell, book and candle 
and the restoration plays have all gone 'round 

sometimes i think about you, baby 
sometimes i cry about you 

sometimes i wanna wrap my coat around you 
sometimes i wanna keep you warm 
sometimes i wanna wrap my coat around you 
sometimes i wanna but i can't afford you
