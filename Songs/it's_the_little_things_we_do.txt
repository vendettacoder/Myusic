well i woke this morning with a teardrop in my eye 
because last night it felt like the best night of my life 
now there's something that is wrong rotting my insides 
and i don't understand why my brain wants to die 

i had women, wine, party time and everything that mattered 
and when i woke up today you know my brain was all in tatters 
i had bits of lungs shrapnel glass and cigarettes for breakfast 
and my lips are blue, my toes are numb and i think i've got the shivers 

it's the little things we do when you go out in the night 
and it's pay day today just for having a good time 
as your hangover unfolds well the questions will arrive 
why do i feel like death just for having a good time 

so i get up and go down the stairs and try to make a sandwich 
but the ham and cheese, margarine they speak an evil language 
it says "don't eat me i don't deserve to be there in your stomach" 
and i break on down and cry why do good time turn to bummers 

it's the little things we do when you go out in the night 
and it's pay day today just for having a good time 
as your hangover unfolds well the questions will arrive 
why do i feel like death just for having a good time
