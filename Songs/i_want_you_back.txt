let me tell you now

when i had you to myself
i didn't want you around
those pretty faces always made you
stand out in a crowd

but someone picked you from the bunch
one glance was all it took
now it's much too late for me
to take a second look

oh baby, give me one more chance
(to show you that i love you)
won't you please let me
back in your heart

oh darling, i was blind to let you go
(let you go, baby)
but now since i see you in his arms
(i want you back)

yes i do now (i want you back)
ooh, ooh baby (i want you back)
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (i want you back)
na na na na

trying to live without your love
is one long sleepless night
let me show you, girl
that i know wrong from right

every street you walk on
i leave tear stains on the ground
following the girl
i didn't even want around
let me tell you now

oh baby, all i need is one more chance
(to show you that i love you)
won't you please let me
back in your heart

oh darlin', i was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
but now since i see you in his arms, uh huh

a buh buh buh buh
a buh buh buh buh
all i want
a buh buh buh buh
all i need
a buh buh buh buh
all i want
a buh buh buh buh
all i need

oh, just one more chance
to show you that i love you
baby (baby), baby (baby), baby (baby)

(i want you back)
forget what happened then
and let me live again

oh baby, i was blind to let you go
but now since i see you in his arms
(i want you back)
spare me of this cause
gimme back what i lost

oh baby, i need one more chance, ha
i tell ya that i love you
baby, ow, baby, baby
i want you back
i want you back
