the hatless tramp is on the ground
over there he's lying down
while the chavs in burberry
pile in without pity

[chorus:]
the whole world's fucked with fucked up people
fucking up fucked up peoples lives
now until the end

in the whorehouse nothing's free
here's a ten-bag follow me
a sack of puppies always drowns
crank it up, get 'em down

there's a ginger boy at school
big boys beat him and are cruel
goodbye mother what's the use
oak tree, dark night, tight noose
