prince alone in the studio
it's two a.m. and all the girls are gone
the girls thought they were going to be able
to have sex with him
they wore their special underwear
once the tracks were laid down
prince's back turned around
raspberry headphones on his head
on his ears

prince alone in the studio
it's three a.m.
prince hasn't eaten in eighteen hours
dinner's burned on the stove
but prince, he doesn't even know

prince alone in the studio
it's four a.m.
and he finally gets that guitar track right
and it's better than anything any girl could ever give him
because prince is alone
prince is alone
oh prince, you are so alone

and when it's all complete
he feels like a hunter on the street
and when it's all complete
he feels like a hunter on the street
