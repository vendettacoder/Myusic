every chance
every chance that i take
i take it on the road
those kilometers and the red lights
i was always looking
left and right
always crashing in the same car
jasmine, i saw you peeping
as i put my foot down to the floor
i was going round and round the hotel garage
must have been touching close to ninety-four
but i'm always crashing in the same car
