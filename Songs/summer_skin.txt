squeaky swings and tall grass
the longest shadows ever cast
the water's warm and children swim
and we frolicked about in our summer skin

i don't recall a single care
just greenery and humid air
then labor day came and went
and we shed what was left of our summer skin

on the night you left i came over
and we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
our brand new coats were so flushed and pink
and i knew your heart i couldn't win
'cause the season's change was a conduit
and we'd left our love in our summer skin
