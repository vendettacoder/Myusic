bus stop, wet day, she's there, i say
"please share my umbrella."
bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows
under my umbrella

all that summer, we enjoyed it
the wind and rain and shine
that umbrella, we employed it
by august, she was mine

every morning, i would see her waiting at the stop
sometimes she'd shop and she would show me what she bought
all the people stared as if we were both quite insane
someday my name and hers are going to be the same

that's the way the whole thing started
silly but it's true
thinkin' of a sweet romance
beginning in a queue

came the sun, the ice was melting
no more sheltering now
nice to think that that umbrella
led me to a vow

every morning, i would see her waiting at the stop
sometimes she'd shop and she would show me what she bought
all the people stared as if we were both quite insane
someday my name and hers are going to be the same

bus stop, wet day, she's there, i say
"please share my umbrella."
bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows
under my umbrella

all that summer, we enjoyed it
wind and rain and shine
that umbrella, we employed it
by august, she was mine
