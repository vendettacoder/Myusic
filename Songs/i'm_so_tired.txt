i'm so tired
i haven't slept a wink
i'm so tired
my mind is on the blink
i wonder, should i get up and fix myself a drink?
no, no, no

i'm so tired
i don't know what to do
i'm so tired
my mind is set on you
i wonder should i call you
but i know what you would do

you'd say i'm putting you on
but it's no joke
it's doing me harm
you know i can't sleep
i can't stop my brain
you know it's three weeks
i'm going insane
you know i'd give you everything i've got for a little peace of mind

i'm so tired
i'm feeling so upset
although i'm so tired
i'll have another cigarette
and curse sir walter raleigh
he was such a stupid git

you'd say i'm putting you on
but it's no joke
it's doing me harm
you know i can't sleep
i can't stop my brain
you know it's three weeks
i'm going insane
you know i'd give you everything i've got for a little peace of mind
i'd give you everything i've got for a little peace of mind
i'd give you everything i've got for a little peace of mind

spoken:
lissum, blussak a mizure, habuts-an-oh'en
tidja tidja tuplay
pleh!
