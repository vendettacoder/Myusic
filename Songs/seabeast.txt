if i stand around 
and watch them drown in a pool of gray
when we dive in
i can surely say there's feud with force
am i in your way? 
please knock me down, can i help you in?
when i'm not around 
let us all be found in certain ways

dear mr. queequeg,
you have been informed your life's been saved
you are not a black-
hearted vicious mess so it has been claimed
if this is the beast
pulling us towards the east with mighty waves
let us look inside
and pull out all your pride, you know it's up to us

holding pasts in ash black earth
bound by roots
roots into sand
grow towards the giver

there's an open wound
placed upon my heart, in anger's rage
if we open up 
a spirit, a spirit that can bleed
ahab the leading lad 
we can trust his obsession carries them
meet us at the temple
healing all the crippled, don't forget the maimed

lower soul 
sent with gifts offering
teeth of hope travel with
child laid next to mother
