reach out and touch faith

your own personal jesus
someone to hear your prayers
someone who cares
your own (your own) personal jesus
someone to hear your prayers
someone who's there

feeling unknown 
and you're all alone
flesh and bone 
by the telephone
lift up the receiver
i'll make you a believer

take second best 
put me to the test
things on your chest
you need to confess
i will deliver
you know i'm a forgiver

reach out and touch faith
