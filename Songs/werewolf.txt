(in a dream i was a werewolf,
my soul was filled with crystal light
lavender ribbons of rain sang,
ridding my heart of mortal fright
of mortal fright...)

broken sundown,
fatherless showdown
gun hip,
swollen lip,
bottle sip,
yeah i suck dick -

loose grip on gravity falls
sky blinding, crumbling walls
let me sweep away my memories of,
children's things, a young mother's love, before the -
the yearning song of flesh on flesh -
young hearts burst open
wounds bleed fresh...

a young brother skinny and tall, my -
older walks ocean-ward and
somber, 
slumber,
sleeping,
flowers in the water...
but i'm just his daughter

walking down an icy grave
leading to my schizophrenic father
weeping willow won't you wallow louder?
searching for my father's power

(i'mma shake you off though,
get up on that horse
and ride into the sunset,
look back with no remorse)

i'mma shake you off though,
get up on that horse
and ride into the sunset,
look back with no remorse

i'mma shake you off though...
look back... (with no remorse)

he's a black magic wielder,
some say a witch -
wielded darkness when he was wiling
on his mom's and unborn child and,
he was the bastard that broke up the marriage

evildoer doing evil from a baby carriage
and he was born with the same blue eyes -
crystal ships, dripping with ice,
diamonds coruscate in the night
fireworks, electric bright

and now he's got's his own two sons, tries to -
hide his tears in a world of fun but
loveless bedrooms filled with doom bring
silent heartache july to june...

swoon over new young heart flame
mourn the memories later,
laugh now alligator...
laugh now alligator...

(in a dream, my father came to me
and made me swear that i keep,
what's sacred to me
and if i get the choice,
to live in his name...
i'll pray my way, through the rain,
singing "oh, happy day...")

i don't mean to close the door but
for the record?
my heart is sore
you blew through me like bullet holes, left -
stains on my sheets and stains on my soul

you left me broke down begging for change had to -
catch a ride with a man whose deranged
he had your hands and my father's face,
another western vampire
different time, same place

i has dreams that brings me sadness
rain much deeper than a river,
sorrow flows through me, tiny waves of shivers...

corny movies make me reminisce
they bring me down easy on this generic love shit
first kiss, frog and princess...

i'mma shake you off though,
get up on that horse
and ride into the sunset,
look back with no remorse

i'mma shake you off though,
get up on that horse
and ride into the sunset,
look back with no remorse

i'mma shake you off though,
get up on that horse
and ride into the sunset,
look back with no remorse

i'mma shake you off though,
get up on that horse
and ride into the sunset,
look back with no remorse

i'mma shake you off though...
look back, with no remorse...
