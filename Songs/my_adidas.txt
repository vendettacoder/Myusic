my adidas talk through concert doors
and roam all over colosseum floors
i stepped on stage, at live aid
all the people gave and the poor got paid
and out of speakers i did speak
i wear my sneakers but i'm not a sneak
my adidas took the stand of a foreign land
with mic in hand, i cold took command
my adidas and me close as can be
we make a good team, my adidas and me
we get around together, rhyme forever
and we won't be mad when worn and weathered

my adidas standin' on 2 fifth st.
funky fresh and yes cold on my feet
with no shoe string in 'em, i did not win 'em
i bought 'em off the ave. with the black lee denim
i like to sport 'em that's why i bought 'em
a sucker tried to steal 'em so i caught 'em and i thwart 'em
and i walk down the street and i bop to the beat
with lee on my legs and adidas on my feet
and now i just standin' here shooting the gip
me and d and my adidas standing on 2 fifth
my adidas
my adidas

now, me and my adidas do the illest things
we like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
we slay all suckers who perpetrate
and lay down law from state to state
we travel on gravel, dirt road or street
i wear my adidas when i rock the beat
on stage front page every show i go
it's adidas on my feet, high-top or low
my adidas
my adidas

now the adidas i possess for one man is rare
myself, homeboy, got 50 pair
got blue and black 'cause i like to chill
and yellow and green when it's time to get ill
got a pair that i wear when i'm playin' ball
with the heel inside make me 10-foot tall
my adidas only bring good news
and they are not used as selling shoes
they're black and white, white with black stripe
the ones i like to wear when i rock the mic
on the strength of our famous university
we took the beat from the street and put it on tv
my adidas are seen on the movie screen
hollywood knows we're good if you know what i mean
we started in the alley, now we chill in cali
and i won't trade 'em in for no beat up ballys
my adidas
