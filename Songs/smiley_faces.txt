well what did you do? 
what did you say?
did you walk or did you run away?

where are you now?
where have you been?
did you go alone or did you bring a friend?

i need to know this, 'cause i noticed you were smilin'
out in the sun, havin fun and feelin' free (oh i'm feelin' free)
and i can tell you know how hard this life can be
but you keep on smilin' for me

(little girl gonna smile at you)
(little girl gonna smile at you)

what went right? 
what went wrong? 
was it the story or was it the song? 
was it overnight or did it take you long? 
was knowing your weakness what made you strong? 

or all the above, oh how i love to see you smiling
and oh yeah, take a little pain just in case
you need something warm to embrace
to help you put on a smiling face

(little girl gonna smile at you)
(little girl gonna smile at you)

put on a smiling face

don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
here's a summary of something that you could smile about
say for instance my girlfriend, she bugs me all the time
but the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

(oh see)
(doo doo doo, doo doo doo)
(doo doo doo, doo doo doo)

i want to be you whenever i see you smiling
because its easily one of the hardest things to do (hardest things to do)
your worries and fears become your friends
and they end up smiling at you

put on a smiling face
