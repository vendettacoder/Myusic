i can't write and i can't sing, i can't do anything
i can't read and i can't spell, i can't even get to hell
i can't love and i can't hate, i can't even hesitate
i can't dance and i can't walk, i can't even try to talk 

freddy tried to strangle me with my plastic popper beads 
but i hit him back, with my pet rat 
yeah i hit him back, with my pet rat 

i can't spit and i can't kick, i can't even be thick 
i can't read and i can't spell, i can't even get to hell 
i can't love and i can't hate, i can't even hesitate 
i can't dance and i can't walk, i can't even try to talk

freddy tried to strangle me with my plastic popper beads

yeah i hit him back, with my pet rat 
yeah i hit him back, with my pet rat
yeah i hit him back, with my pet rat
