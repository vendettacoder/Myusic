childhood living is easy to do
the things you wanted, i bought them for you
graceless lady, you know who i am
you know i can't let you slide through my hands.

wild horses couldn't drag me away
wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away.

i watched you suffer a dull aching pain
now you've decided to show me the same
no sweeping exits or off stage lights
could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind.

wild horses couldn't drag me away
wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away.

i know i've dreamed you, a sin and a lie
i had my freedom but i don't have much time
faith has been broken, tears must be cried
let's do some living after we die.

wild horses couldn't drag me away
wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day.

wild horses couldn't drag me away 
wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day.
