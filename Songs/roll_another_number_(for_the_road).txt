it's too dark to put the keys in my ignition,
and the mornin' sun is yet to climb my hood ornament.
but before too long i might see those flashing red lights
look out, mama, 'cause i'm comin' home tonight.

think i'll roll another number for the road,
i feel able to get under any load.
though my feet aren't on the ground,
i been standin' on the sound
of some open-hearted people goin' down.

i'm not goin' back to woodstock for a while,
though i long to hear that lonesome hippie smile.
i'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
no, i don't believe i'll be goin' back that way.

think i'll roll another number for the road,
i feel able to get under any load.
though my feet aren't on the ground,
i been standin' on the sound
of some open-hearted people goin' down.
