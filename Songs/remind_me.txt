it's only been a week
the rush of being home in rapid fading
prevailing to recall
what i was missing all that time in england

has sent me aimlessly
on foot or by the help of transportation
to knock on windows where
a friend no longer live, i had forgotten

and everywhere i go
there's always something to remind me
of another place and time
where love that travelled far had found me

we stayed outside till two
waiting for the light to come back
we didn't talk i knew
until you asked what i was thinking
until you asked what i was thinking

brave men tell the truth
the wise man's tools are analogies and puzzles
a woman holds her tongue
knowing silence will speak for her

so now i'll never know
as you no longer sleep beside me, and everywhere i go

will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me

will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me

it's only been a week
the rush of being home in rapid fading
prevailing to recall
what i was missing all that time in england

has sent me aimlessly
on foot or by the help of transportation
to knock on windows where
a friend no longer live, i had forgotten

will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
will remind, will remind, will remind me
