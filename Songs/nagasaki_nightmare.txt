they're always there high in the skies...
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
pretty as a picture in the generals' eyes
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
they've done it once, they'll do it again
they'll shower us all in their deadly rain
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare

fishing children fish in the imperial waters
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
sons and lovers, lovers and daughters
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
cherry blossom hanging on the cherry blossom tree
flash, blinding flash, then there's nothing to see
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare

dying they're still dying, one by one
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
darkness in the land of the rising sun
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
lesson learnt the lesson? no, cos no one really cares
it's so easy to be silent just to cover up your fears
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare

so they die in the nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
and live with the nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
will you stand by and let it happen again?
nightmare death in the deadly rain
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare

live with the nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
and die in the nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
nightmare comes in deadly rain
nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, rain
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare

manmade power, manmade pain, nagasaki nightmare
deadly rain, deadly rain, nagasaki nightmare
they'll do it again, shower us in rain
deadly, deadly, deadly rain
nagasaki nightmare, nagasaki nightmare
