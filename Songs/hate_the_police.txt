mommy, mommy, mommy
look at your son
you might have loved me
but now i got a gun
you better stay out of my way
i think i've had a bad day
i've had a bad day
i've had a bad day

daddy, daddy, daddy
proud of your son
got himself a good job
killing niggers and mexicans
i'll tell you one thing, it's true
you can't find justice, it'll find you
it'll find you
it'll find you

people tell policemen
they've met their match
down in them desert sands
mudhoney won't catch
mudhoney hates policemen, yes, it's true
you can't find justice, it'll find you
it'll find you
it'll find you
it'll find you

mommy, mommy
look at your son
you might have loved me
a gun
you better stay out of my way
i've had a bad day
i've had a bad day
mommy, i've had a bad day
mommy, i've had a bad day
