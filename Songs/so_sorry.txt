i'm sorry
two words i always think 
after you're gone
when i realize i was acting all wrong

so selfish
two words that could describe
oh, actions of mine 
when patience is in short supply

we don't need to say goodbye
we don't need to fight and cry
oh we, we could hold each other tight
tonight

we're so helpless
we're slaves to our impulses
we're afraid of our emotions
no one, knows where the shore is

we're divided by the ocean
and the only thing i know is
the answer it isn't for us
no the answer isn't for us

i'm sorry
two words i always think 
after you're gone
when i realize i was acting all wrong

we don't need to say goodbye
we don't need to fight and cry
no we, we could, we could hold each other tight
tonight...
tonight...
tonight...
tonight...
