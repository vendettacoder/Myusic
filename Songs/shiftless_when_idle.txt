everybody that's on my block
they're tired of me, that ain't no shock
and i ain't got no idols
i ain't got much taste
i'm shiftless when i'm idle
i got time to waste

they tried to tell me that i should learn
they told me it's best i wait my turn
i can't wait forever
i can't wait that long
i'm shiftless when i'm idle
i want to play this ...

i'm shiftless when i'm idle
i'm shiftless when i'm idle
i'm shiftless
i'm shiftless
