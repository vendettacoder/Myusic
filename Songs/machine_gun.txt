i saw a saviour, a saviour come my way
i thought i'd see it in the cold light of day
but now i realize that i'm only for me

if only i could see, return myself to me
and recognize the poison in my heart
there is no other place, no one else i face
the remedy will agree with how i feel

here in my reflecting, what more can i say?
for i am guilty for the voice that i obey
too scared to sacrifice the choice chosen for me

if only i could see, return myself to me
and recognize the poison in my heart
there is no other place, no one else i face
the remedy to agree with how i feel
