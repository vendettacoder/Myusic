i've never seen a diamond in the flesh
i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
and i'm not proud of my address
in a torn-up town, no postcode envy

but every song's like
gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

but everybody's like
cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals (royals)
it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

let me be your ruler (ruler)
you can call me queen bee
and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

my friends and i, we've cracked the code
we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us, knows that we're fine with this
we didn't come from money

but every song's like
gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

but everybody's like
cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals (royals)
it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

let me be your ruler (ruler)
you can call me queen bee
and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy

oh oh oh
we're bigger than we ever dreamed
and i'm in love with being queen

oh oh oh
life is great without a care
we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals (royals)
it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

let me be your ruler (ruler)
you can call me queen bee
and baby, i'll rule (i'll rule, i'll rule, i'll rule)
let me live that fantasy
