crawling
over your window, you think i'm confused
i'm waiting for the divergent wasp
to complete my current ruse

you use a plate-glass screen
to protect my chosen target
but there's an air-pellet hole
i can crawl through to you

i am the fly in the ointment
i can spread more disease than the fleas
which nibble away at your window display

yes, i am the fly in the ointment
i shake you down to say please
as you accept the next dose of disease

i am the fly, i am the fly
i am the fly, i am the fly
fly in the, fly in the ointment
i am the fly, i am the fly
i am the fly, i am the fly
fly in the, fly in the ointment

i am the fly, i am the fly
i am the fly, i am the fly
fly in the, fly in the ointment
yes, i am the fly, i am the fly
i am the fly, i am the fly
fly in the, fly in the ointment
i am the fly, i am the fly
i am the fly, i am the fly
fly in the, fly in the ointment
yes, i am the fly, i am the fly
i am the fly, i am the fly
fly in the, fly in the ointment

i am the fly
