prince

remember when i met you, baby,
you were on your way to be wed
you were such a sexy thing,
i loved the way you walked, the things you said

i was so nonchalant
i didn't want you to be misled
but i got to have you, baby
i got to have you in my bed

you said, "i'm just a virgin and i'm
on my way to be wed
but you're such a hunk,
so full of spunk,
i'll give you"

head
til you're burning up
head
til you get enough
head
til your love is red
head
love you til you're dead

you know you're good, girl
i think you like to go down
you wouldn't have stopped but
i came, on getting down

you said, "i must confess
i want to get undressed
and go to bed"
with that, i changed
you fool, you married me instead
now, morning, noon, and night i give you

head
til you're burning up
head
til you get enough
head
til your love is red
head
love you til you're dead

ahhh!

oooh yeah
oooh yeah
oooh yeah

head

oooh
ahhh!
