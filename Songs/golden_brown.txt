golden brown, texture like sun
lays me down with my mind she runs
throughout the night
no need to fight
never a frown with golden brown

every time just like the last
on her ship tied to the mast
to distant lands
takes both my hands
never a frown with golden brown

golden brown, finer temptress
through the ages she's heading west
from far away
stays for a day
never a frown with golden brown

(la la la la la la la la leeeah)

never a frown
with golden brown
never a frown
with golden brown
