who was that on the window ledge? 
did he jump or was he pushed? 
he left a note which no one read 
in desperate hand the note just said: 
"never turn my back on society 
society turn is back on me. 
never tried once to drop out, 
i just couldn't get in from the start."

the children all played clever games 
the grown-ups gave them clever names 
turned them all from very young 
on to the drug competition 
feed them t.v. everyday 
teach them just how they should play 
for the ones that start to stray 
cut them off till they obey

our little friend was not the type 
to want to have to stand and fight 
bully boys all could pick 
upon the lonely little kid 
the grown ups all looked hard and long 
said "he's got two feet he can stand on" 
we never like the sickly ones 
the boisterous ones are much more fun

he found it hard to socialize 
cause when he laughed or want he cried 
in the wrong place he'd be chastised 
an idiot to be despised 
never learnt to play the game the way 
that your supposed to play 
never learnt the things to say 
or lock emotion safe away

who was that on the window ledge? 
did he jump or was he pushed? 
he left a note which no one read 
in desperate hand the note just said: 
"never turn my back on society 
society turn is back on me. 
all the world can not be wrong 
it must be me i don't belong." 
"all the world can not be wrong 
it must be me i don't belong" 
"all the world can not be wrong 
it must be me i don't belong" 
"all the world can not be wrong 
it must be me i don't belong" 
"all the world can not be wrong 
it must be me i don't belong"

the unfree child is full of woe 
into the unfree adult he will grow 
have unfree children of is own 
on and on and so it goes

take your hands from off your genitals 
eat those greens and grow up strong 
don't piss yourself it's very naughty 
stephen, stephen don't you shine 
don't speak now we are talking 
not a word less you disgrace 
there's people listening 
don't embarrass us 
and never let us catch you masturbate

when i was a baby my mummy told me 
if i was a bad boy daddy would scold me 
when i was a baby my mummy lectured 
if i was a good boy i would be rewarded

mummy, daddy, what more would you expected
in your eyes i'm not to be respected
take you on but i'm just one reflection
of the values that you hold and the way you see them

my mummy's gone 
to a place where i can't go 
a place that's cloaked in thy mystery 
of corporate identity 
supermarkets and three pike suits 
my mummy's gone 
my mummy's gone

when i was a little girl my mummy told me 
had to make an effort to make myself pretty 
got to get a husband, got to have a baby 
got to be a credit to the rest of the family

mummy, daddy, what more would you expected
in your eyes i'm not to be respected
take you on but i'm just one reflection
of the values that you hold and the way you see them

my mummy's gone 
to a place where i can't go 
a place that's cloaked in thy mystery 
of corporate identity 
supermarkets and three pike suits 
my mummy's gone 
my mummy's gone

now that i'm older, i know that you scared me 
but i don't hold it against you, though it damage me sorley 
i know you're a victim just just like me 
you can feel the pressure just just like me

mummy, daddy, what more would you expected
in your eyes i'm not to be respected
take you on but i'm just one reflection
of the values that you hold and the way you see them

my mummy's gone 
to a place where i can't go 
a place that's cloaked in thy mystery 
of corporate identity 
supermarkets and three pike suits 
my mummy's gone 
my mummy's gone
