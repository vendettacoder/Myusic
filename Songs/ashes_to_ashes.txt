do you remember a guy that's been
in such an early song?
i've heard a rumour from ground control
oh no, don't say it's true

they got a message from the action man:
"i'm happy, hope you're happy, too
i've loved all i've needed love
sordid details following"

the shrieking of nothing is killing just
pictures of jap girls in synthesis and i
ain't got no money and i ain't got no hair
but i'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...

ashes to ashes, funk to funky
we know major tom's a junkie
strung out in heaven's high
hitting an all-time low

time and again, i tell myself
i'll stay clean tonight
but the little green wheels are following me
oh no, not again
i'm stuck with a valuable friend
i'm happy, hope you're happy, too
one flash of light but no smoking pistol

i've never done good things
i've never done bad things
i never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
want an axe to break the ice
wanna come down right now

ashes to ashes, funk to funky
we know major tom's a junkie
strung out in heaven's high
hitting an all-time low

my mother said, "to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom"
my mother said, "to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom"
my mother said, "to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom"
my mother said, "to get things done
you'd better not mess with major tom"
