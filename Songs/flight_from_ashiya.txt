bursts of white cotton passing the window
everyone talking, oh, so very low
and captain simpson seems to be in a daze
one minute high, the next minute low
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are

cigarettes burning faster and faster
everyone talking about the everafter
and captain simpson seems to be in a daze
one minute high, the next minute low
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are

nobody will ever know why
nobody will ever know why

visions of childhood rush past my eyes
in seat number 30 somebody cries
and captain simpson seems to be in a daze
one minute high, the next minute low

nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are
nobody knows where we are
