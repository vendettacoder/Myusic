last night, i had a dream about you
in this dream, i'm dancing right beside you
and it looked like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling i've waited so long

don't stop, come a little closer
as we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
there's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
we were dancing all night long

the time is right to put my arms around you
you're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
but suddenly i feel the shining sun
before i knew it, this dream was all gone

ooh, i don't know what to do
about this dream and you
i wish this dream comes true

ooh, i don't know what to do
about this dream and you
we'll make this dream come true

why don't you play the game?
why don't you play the game?
