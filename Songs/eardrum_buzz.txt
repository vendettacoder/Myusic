this is the night, here in the day

it's the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

zee zee zee, zum zum
buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

now you live in the world of the wave
and you scratch your name on the walls of the cave
instincts never leave you perfectly clear
there's always a buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

zee zee zee, zum zum
buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

marco polo has lost his way
the louisville lip has nothing to say
one thing remains perfectly clear
the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

zee zee zee, zum zum
buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

custard jack has lost his mac
captain flash won't give it back
it seemed to them both perfectly clear
the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

buffalo bill, deprived of will
chasing a hamburger down the hill
it seemed to him perfectly clear
the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

zee zee zee, zum zum
buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

adolf turned out very nice
hannibal is afraid of mice
one thing remains perfectly clear
it's the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

zee zee zee, zum zum
buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
