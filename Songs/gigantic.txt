and this i know, his teeth as white as snow
what a gas it was to see him
walk her every day into a shady place
with her lips, she said, she said

hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball

gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
a big, big love
gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
a big, big love

lovely legs there are
what a big black mass, what a hunk of love
he'll walk her every day into a shady place
he's like the dark, but i'd want him

hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball

gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
a big, big love
gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
a big, big love

gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
a big, big love
gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
a big, big love

a big, big love
a big, big love
a big, big love
a big, big love

a big, big love
a big, big love
a big, big love
a big, big love
