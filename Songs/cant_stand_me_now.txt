"an ending fitting for the start
you twist and tore our love apart
your light fingers threw the dark
shattered the lamp, into darkness it cast us"

"no, you've got it the wrong way round
you just shut me up and blamed it on the brown"
cornered the boy kicked out at the world
the world kicked back a lot fucking harder, oh

if you wanna try, if you wanna try
there's no worse you could do, oh oh oh
i know you lie, i know you lie
i'm still in love with you, oh oh oh

can't take me anywhere, i'll take you anywhere
you can't take me anywhere, i can't take you anywhere
i'll take you anywhere you wanna go

oh, you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
oh, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now

have we enough to keep it together?
or do we just keep on pretending
and hope our luck is never ending?
you tried to pull the wool, i wasn't feeling too clever
and you take all that they're lending
until you needed mending, oh

if you wanna try, if you wanna try
there's no worse you could do, oh oh oh
i know you lie, all you do is make me cry
and all those words, they ain't true

i can't take me anywhere, i can't take you anywhere
can't take me anywhere, well, i won't take you anywhere
i take you anywhere you want to go

oh, you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now

you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now
you can't stand me now
