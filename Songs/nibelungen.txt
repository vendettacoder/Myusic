since the first of you and me asleep
in a nibelungen land
titanic curses trap me in
a banishment of stay
symbols vanish from my senses
stem and stave the view appears

symbols captured in a trance
vanish from my glance
for the various defenses
i enforce a strike the alarm
for the various defences
that choose to be here and there
and lose the direction everywhere

since the first of you and me asleep
in a nibelungen land where we cannot be
almond trees grow along the mountain trail
from their tongues the words are spelling
the telling numb

i cannot hear it anymore
i cannot hear it anymore

since the first of you and me here and there
we lose the direction everywhere
shrieking city sun shiver in my veins
in flames i run
in flames i run
waiting for the sign to come

will you spell the words for me
will you spell the words for me to hear
nibelungen
nibelungen
nibelungen land
