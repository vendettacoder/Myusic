oh my god, did i just say that out loud?
should've known this was the kind of place
that sort of thing just wasn't allowed
should've known by the color of the drapes
(oh, my bad, venetian blinds)
what the hell was i thinking, saying exactly what's on my mind?
but i won't deny i got a dirty mouth
my mother tried, my father tried, my teachers tried
but they couldn't wash it out
and look at me now, up here running my mouth
i just open it up and see what comes running out
well, here it comes now

like i give a fuck, like i give a shit, like i give a fuck about that shit
like i give a fuck about that motherfucking shit

and you can tell the president to suck my fucking dick
does that sound intelligent? like i give a fucking frick
tell the fbi, put me on the list because lennon wasn't this dangerous
call the christians, tell them all that i'm taller than jesus
they tore down the parking lot and put in a parking lot and what do they got?
and if you followed the plot, then you know i'm not going to give it a second thought
yeah, let those pigs play because they'll all fucking pay
yeah, karma's a fact, that shit'll come back someday
and i'll be like

like i give a fuck, like i give a shit like i give a shit about that fuck
like i give a fuck about that motherfucking shit
