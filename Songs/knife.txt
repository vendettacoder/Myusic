like a child could have the trigger
and the best man needn't fall
to understand that heaven
could be any place at all

just five colours set in motion
and i try again to place it
and it features are obscure
everytime i turn to face it

but i still chase it

oh its twists are cruel and hopeless
like neglet has worn it thin
and it could rip the sky wide open
and let the rain come tumbling

and we wait on every whisper
like it makes us more alive
there's a sense we didn't have
and i feel it in the other five

see the pity and the pride
in the same sea of emotion
cut my hands and touch the tide
and expect to feel the ocean
it's just a notion

and the knife has got my number
and the number that you keep
and the knife is called division
and it's drawn when i'm asleep

oh its twists are cruel and hopeless
like neglet has worn it thin
and it could rip the sky wide open
and let the rain come tumbling
