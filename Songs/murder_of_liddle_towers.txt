why did he die, or did they lie?
i think he's dead, so a doctor said
he was beaten black, he was beaten blue
but don't be alarmed, it was the right thing to do
the police have the power, police have the right
to kill a man to take away his life
drunk and disorderly was his crime
i think at worst he should be doing time
but he's dead
he was drunk and disorderly and now he's dead

questions are unanswered
policeman scared to talk
perhaps they are hiding something
will my message get across
please tell me why, why did he die
please tell me now, and tell me how

police have the answers
but they haven't got the right, to kill a man
to take away his life
perhaps i'm not to clever, perhaps i'm not to bright
but i think your verdict was just a lie, a lie, a lie, lie

murder, murder, murder, murder...
murder
