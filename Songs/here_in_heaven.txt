here, there are lots of things to do
and a panoramic view
of the universe completely surrounding you

and here you cannot buy souvenirs
you're never going back, never, never
basically, i guess it could be worse
yes, i do suppose it could be worse

here, there are many, many sheep
and the people only sleep
and awake to tell how gory and gruesome was their end
and i don't have many friends
and it's really very clean and i'm thinking
juliet, you broke our little pact
juliet, i'm never coming back

up here in heaven without you
i'm here in heaven without you
up here in heaven without you
it is hell knowing that your health will keep you out of here
for many many years

dear, do you often think of me
as you overlook the sea
do i qualify as dearly departed or am i
that sucker in the sky
the fall guy for the first and the last time
juliet, i thought we had agreed
now i know why you let me take the lead

up here in heaven without you
i'm here in heaven without you
up here in heaven without you
it is hell knowing that your health will keep you out of here
for many many years

second thoughts, is that what you had?
second thoughts, first i broke my back
second thoughts, as i hit the sea
second thoughts, for eternity, for eternity, for eternity

up here in heaven without you
i'm here in heaven without you
up here in heaven without you
it is hell knowing that your health will keep you out of here
for years and years and years
