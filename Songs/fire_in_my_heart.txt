i've got a fire in my heart for you,
i've got a fire in my heart for you,
i've got a fire in my heart, though i'm falling apart,
still i've got a fire in my heart for you.

i've got pins and needles for you,
i've got pins and needles for you,
you've got needles and pins, and the seven deadly sins,
still i've got a fire in my heart for you.

i've a butterfly stomach for you,
i've a butterfly stomach for you,
and as the cars fly by, i just break down and cry,
still i've got a fire in my heart for you.

well the monkey puzzle tree,
has some questions,
for the watchdogs of the profane,
and i ask is it sad,
that i'm driving myself mad,
douse this fire in my heart turns blue

i've got a fire in my heart for you,
i've got a fire in my heart for you,
i've got a fire in my heart for you,
i've got a fire in my heart for you.
