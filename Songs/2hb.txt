oh i was moved by your screen dream
celluloid pictures of living
your death could not kill our love for you
take two people - romantic
smoky nightclub situation
your cigarette traces a ladder
here's looking at you kid
celebrate years
here's looking at you kid
wipe away tears
long time, since we're together
now i hope it's forever
ideal love flies away now
white jacket, mmmn, black tie wings too
you gave her away to the hero
words don't express my meaning
notes could not spell out the score
but finding not keeping's the lesson
here's looking at you kid
hard to forget
here's looking at you kid
at least not yet
your memory stays
it lingers ever
will fade away never
