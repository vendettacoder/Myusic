thunder shook loose hail
on the outhouse again
today i bumped into you again
i have no idea what you want
but there was something i meant to say

as the day stops dead
at the place where we're lost
i will drug you and fuck you
on the permafrost

there's not much that i miss
i'm far too forgetful for that
sugar's sweet some of the time
it's hard to keep some things in mind

as the day stops dead ...
