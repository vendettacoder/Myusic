hope no one sees me in this accident
hope no one sees me in this accident
with my feet down through the floorboards
and my head up through the busted glass and my face smashed against the dash
there's no attraction like a fatal crash
and someone said it was a right i didn't have
and someone said it was reckless u-turn
and someone said another sunday driver

let's go see who's in an accident
see who's poking through the floor boards
who's head is up against the glass
who's face is smashed against the dash
let's go see who's in an accident
let's go see who's in an accident
let's go see who's in an accident
