yeah, i'm losing my edge, i'm losing my edge
the kids are coming up from behind
i'm losing my edge, i'm losing my edge
to the kids from france and from london
but i was there, i was there in 1968
i was there at the first can show in cologne
i'm losing my edge, i'm losing my edge
to the kids whose footsteps i hear when they get on the decks
i'm losing my edge to the internet seekers
who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978

i'm losing my edge, i'm losing my edge
to all the kids in tokyo and berlin
i'm losing my edge
to the art-school brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties

but i'm losing my edge, i'm losing my edge
but i was there
i was there but i was there

i'm losing my edge, i'm losing my edge
i can hear the footsteps every night on the decks
but i was there, i was there in 1974
the first suicide practices in a loft in new york city
i was working on the organ sounds with much patience
i was there when captain beefheart started up his first band
i told him, "don't do it that way. you'll never make a dime."
i was there, i was the first guy playing daft punk to the rock kids
i played it at cbgb's, everybody thought i was crazy
we all know i was there
i was there, i've never been wrong
i used to work in the record store
i had everything before anyone
i was there in the paradise garage dj booth with larry levan
i was there in jamaica during the great sound clashes
i woke up naked on the beach in ibiza in 1988

but i'm losing my edge
to better-looking people with better ideas and more talent
and who're actually really, really nice

i'm losing my edge

i heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody
every great song by the the beach boys
all the underground hits
all the modern lovers tracks
i heard you have a vinyl of every niagra record on german import
i heard that you have a white label of every seminal detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87
i heard that you have a cd compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s

i hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real
you want to make a yaz record
i hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables
i hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars
i hear everybody that you know is more relevant than everybody that i know
