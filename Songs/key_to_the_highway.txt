i got the key to the highway
billed out and bound to go
i'm gonna leave here running
walking is much too slow

i'm going back to the border
woman, where i'm better known
you know you haven't done nothing
drove a good man away from home

oh give me one, one more kiss mama
just before i go
'cause when i leave this time you know i
i won't be back no more

i got the key, key to the highway
billed out and bound to go
i'm gonna leave here running
walking is most too slow

i got the key, key to the highway
billed out and bound to go
i'm gonna leave here running
walking is most too slow

i'm going back, back to the border
babe, i'd better go
you know you haven't done nothing
drove a good man away from home
