i'm ready
i'm ready for the laughing gas
i'm ready
i'm ready for what's next
i'm ready to duck, i'm ready to dive
i'm ready to say i'm glad to be alive
i'm ready
i'm ready for the push

in the cool of the night
in the warmth of the breeze
i'll be crawling around
on my hands and knees

she's just down the line
zoo station
got to make it on time
zoo station

i'm ready
i'm ready for the gridlock
i'm ready
to take it to the street
i'm ready for the shuffle, ready for the deal
ready to let go of the steering wheel
i'm ready
ready for the crush

zoo station
zoo station

all right
all right, all right, all right, all right
it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby
it's all right, it's all right

time is a train
makes the future the past
leaves you standing in the station
your face pressed up against the glass

i'm just down the line from your love
zoo station
i'm under the sign of your love
zoo station
i'm gonna make it on time, make it on time
zoo station
zoo station
i'm gonna be there
zoo station
it's all right
zoo station
just two stops down the line
zoo station
just a stop down the line
