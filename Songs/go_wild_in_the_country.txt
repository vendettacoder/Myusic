i don't like you
i don't like your town
i don't wanna like you
i'll shop around

i don't want you
i don't want your town
i don't wanna want you
i'll shop around
i'll shop around

i can get a train
i don't need no hamburgers
no take-away
i want my own game
no bake and take
no strawberry milkshake

i wanna picnic
i'm, sick - sick of seeing signs to eat
walking down these dark lonely streets

i don't know you
i don't know your town
i don't wanna know you
i'll shop around
i'll shop around

i can get a train
i don't need no hamburgers
no take-away
i want my own game
no bake and take
no strawberry milkshake

i do better
hell i do better
swinging in the trees
naked in the breeze
but i got no boiled chicken
i wanna go hunting and fishing

wild wild go wild in the country
where snakes in the grass are absolutely free
wild wild go wild in the country
where snakes in the grass are absolutely free

i can get a plane
i don't need no suitcases
'cause true loves go naked

wild wild go wild in the country
where snakes in the grass are absolutely free
wild wild go wild in the country
where snakes in the grass are absolutely free

i want a picnic
'cause i get sick
got no boiled chicken
i wanna go hunting and fishing

wild wild go wild in the country
where snakes in the grass are absolutely free
wild wild go wild in the country
where snakes in the grass are absolutely free

i can get a train
i don't need no hamburgers
no take-away
'cause i can hunt my own game
