you eclipse them all you eclipse them all
you eclipse them all you eclipse them all

all through the night
though i tried
couldn't think of much else
i'm halfway home
got a racing mind
engine grinds me like a pulse

you eclipse them all you eclipse them all
you eclipse them all you eclipse them all

i knew your style was bold
when you crossed the finishing line
continue what you've begun
i will rise to it every time

you eclipse them all you eclipse them all
you eclipse them all you eclipse them all

in every direction
in every sound you are near
you are breaking at my shore
i'm getting warmer
i want to be the best you've had
shadow you forevermore

you eclipse them all you eclipse them all
you eclipse them all you eclipse them all

all through the night you distract
lost my mind at the very first contact
pull it until it snaps
you step back
see me react

in every direction
in every sound you are near
you are breaking at my shore
i'm getting warmer
i want to be the best you've had
shadow you forevermore

you eclipse them all you eclipse them all
you eclipse them all you eclipse them all
