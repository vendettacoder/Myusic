oh i've just come
from the land of the sun
from a war that must be won
in the name of truth
with our soldiers so brave
your freedom we will save
with our rifles and grenades
and some help from god
i want to see my family
my wife and child waiting for me
i've got to go home
i've been so alone, you see

you just can't believe
the joy i did receive
when i finally got my leave
and i was going home
oh i flew through the sky
my convictions could not lie
for my country i would die
and i will see it soon
i want to see my family
my wife and child waiting for me
i've got to go home
i've been so alone, you see

when i walked through the door
my wife she lay upon the floor
and with tears her eyes were sore
i did not know why
then i looked into her hand
and i saw the telegram
that said that i was a brave, brave man
but that i was dead
i want to see my family
my wife and child waiting for me
i've got to go home
