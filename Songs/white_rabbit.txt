one pill makes you larger
and one pill makes you small
and the ones that mother gives you
don't do anything at all
go ask alice
when she's ten feet tall

and if you go chasing rabbits
and you know you're going to fall
tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
has given you the call
call alice
when she was just small

when the men on the chessboard
get up and tell you where to go
and you've just had some kind of mushroom
and your mind is moving low
go ask alice
i think she'll know

when logic and proportion
have fallen sloppy dead
and the white knight is talking backwards
and the red queen's off with her head
remember what the dormouse said
feed your head
feed your head
