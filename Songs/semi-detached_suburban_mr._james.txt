so you've finally named the day when wedding-bells will chime
i was sorry to hear you say, you're gonna be his not mine
do you think you will be happy, giving up your friends
for your semi-detached suburban mr. james?

so you've finally got your man, i hope you won't regret it
he can't love you the way i can, so please don't you forget it
so you think you will be happy, buttering the toast
i'm your semi-detached suburban mr. most

i can see in the morning time, washing clean, the weather' s fine
hanging things upon the line, and as your love slips away, hey, hey

so you've finally named the day when wedding-bells will chime
i was sorry to hear you say, you're gonna be his not mine
so you think you will be happy, taking doggie for a walk
with your semi-detached suburban mr. (james)
semi-detached suburban mr. (james)
semi-detached suburban mr. james
so you've finally named the day
so you've finally named the day.
