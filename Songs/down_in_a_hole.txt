bury me softly in this womb
i give this part of me for you
sand rains down and here i sit
holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom

down in a hole and i don't know if i can be saved
see my heart, i decorate it like a grave
you don't understand who they thought i was supposed to be
look at me now, a man who won't let himself be

down in a hole
feeling so small
down in a hole
losing my soul

i'd like to fly
but my wings have been so denied

down in a hole, and they've put all the stones in their place
i've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
i have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
i will speak no more of my feelings beneath

down in a hole
feeling so small
down in a hole
losing my soul

i'd like to fly
but my wings have been so denied

bury me softly in this womb
(oh i want to be inside of you)
i give this part of me for you
(oh i want to be inside of you)
sand rains down and here i sit
holding rare flowers
(oh i want to be inside of you)
in a tomb
(oh i want to be inside)

down in a hole
feeling so small
down in a hole
losing my soul
down in a hole
feeling so small
down in a hole
out of control
i'd like to fly
but my wings have been so denied
