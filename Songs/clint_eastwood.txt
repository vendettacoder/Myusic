ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on
it's coming on
it's coming on...

del the funky homosapien
yeah... ha ha!
finally someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing 'cause i'm countin' no age
now i couldn't be there
now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs
and i'm under each snare
intangible
bet you didn't think so, i command you to
panoramic view
look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose
sit and lose
all you different crews
chicks and dudes
who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse
you think it's fictional
mystical? maybe
spiritual
hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
lifeless
to know the definition for what life is
priceless
for you because i put you on the hype shit
you like it?
gunsmokin' righteous with one token
psychic among those
possess you with one go

del the funky homosapien
the essence, the basics
without it you make it
allow me to make this
childlike in nature
rhythm
you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them
every sprouting tree
every child of peace
every cloud at sea
you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise
corruption in disguise
from this fuckin' enterprise
now i'm sucked into your lies
through russell, not his muscles, but percussion he provides
with me as a guide
y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
you perceive with your mind
that's the in (motherfucker)
so i'm gonna stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers
remember where the thought is
i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless
feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
no squealing, remember
that it's all in your head!
