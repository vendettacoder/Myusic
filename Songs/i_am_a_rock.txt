a winter's day
in a deep and dark december
i am alone
gazing from my window to the streets below
on a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
i am a rock, i am an island

i've built walls
a fortress deep and mighty
that none may penetrate
i have no need of friendship
friendship causes pain
it's laughter and it's loving i disdain
i am a rock, i am an island

don't talk of love
well, i've heard the word before
it's sleeping in my memory
i won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
if i never loved, i never would have cried
i am a rock, i am an island

i have my books
and my poetry to protect me
i am shielded in my armor
hiding in my room, safe within my womb
i touch no one, and no one touches me
i am a rock, i am an island

and a rock feels no pain
and an island never cries
