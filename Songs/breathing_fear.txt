so full of hope that he can't sit still
even in the presence of strangers.
he's expecting his favourite guest,
the boy with easy virtues.
but when the boy arrives,
he's got a black eye
from the lads who plague us outside.
he laughs and calls for the world to die,
then hugs and kisses it better.
**chorus**
tell him why do you go to extremes
and how it must show.
****
he's half-full of courage and he
stumbles to work,
where they bitch about their babies.
they ask him where he got his bruises.,
he mumbles excuses, he lies and lies.
he cannot allow them to finish him off.
over-heated, overwrought.
he refuses to die like a saint,
half-believed and always deceived.
****
chorus
****
giving us grief for centuries now,
can't you ever rest?
beaten, insulted, skewered and branded.
isn't waking enough?
you're breathing this fear just once a year,
we suffocate every day.
hey... you're breathing this fear just once a year,
we suffocate every day!
