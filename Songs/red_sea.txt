14 quiet days
these hours just slept in your place
white sand and a vague
sense of youth
how can i get through
it's a violent truth
that i'm like you

16 lonely hours 
no sun or depth
15 dreams of you all alone
but still far from reach
crosses traced in white sand 
it's a violent truth
that i'm like you

you said the first time was so perfect 
but the rest was all just wrong
you said there too many gone too long
