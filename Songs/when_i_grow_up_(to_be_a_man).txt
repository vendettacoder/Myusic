when i grow up to be a man

will i dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
will i look back and say that i wish i hadn't done what i did?
will i joke around and still dig those sounds
when i grow up to be a man?

will i look for the same things in a woman that i dig in a girl?
(14, 15)
will i settle down fast or will i first want to travel the world?
(16, 17)
well, i'm young and free, but how will it be
when i grow up to be a man?

ooh, ooh, ooh
will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
(18, 19)
when they're out having fun, yeah, will i still wanna have my share?
(20, 21)
will i love my wife for the rest of my life
when i grow up to be a man?

what will i be when i grow up to be a man?

(24, 25)
it's kind of sad
(26, 27)
won't last forever
(28, 29)
it's kind of sad
(30, 31)
won't last forever
