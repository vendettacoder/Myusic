certainly the children have seen them,
in quiet places where the moss grows green.
coloured shells jangle together,
the wind is cold, the year is old, the trees whisper together
and bent in the wind, they lean.

next week a monkey is coming to stay.

if i was a witches' hat,
sitting on her head like a paraffin stove,
i'd fly away and be a bat,
across the air i would rove.

stepping like a tightrope walker,
putting one foot after another,
wearing black cherries for rings.
