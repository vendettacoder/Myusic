they seek him here, they seek him there
his clothes are loud, but never square
it will make or break him so he's got to buy the best
'cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

and when he does his little rounds
'round the boutiques of london town
eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends
'cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
he thinks he is a flower to be looked at
and when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight
he feels a dedicated follower of fashion

oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
there's one thing that he loves and that is flattery
one week he's in polka-dots, the next week he's in stripes
'cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

they seek him here, they seek him there
in regent street and leicester square
everywhere the carnabetian army marches on
each one a dedicated follower of fashion

oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
his world is built 'round discotheques and parties
this pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best
'cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
oh yes, he is (oh yes, he is)
he flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly
in matters of the cloth, he is as fickle as can be
'cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion
he's a dedicated follower of fashion
he's a dedicated follower of fashion
