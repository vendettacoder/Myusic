out where the river broke
the bloodwood and the desert oak
holden wrecks and boiling diesels
steam in forty five degrees

the time has come
to say fair's fair
to pay the rent
to pay our share

the time has come
a fact's a fact
it belongs to them
let's give it back

how can we dance when our earth is turning?
how do we sleep while our beds are burning?
how can we dance when our earth is turning?
how do we sleep while our beds are burning?

the time has come
to say fair's fair
to pay the rent
now, to pay our share

four wheels scare the cockatoos
from kintore east to yuendemu
the western desert lives and breathes
in forty-five degrees

the time has come
to say fair's fair
to pay the rent
ah, to pay our share

the time has come (ow!)
a fact's a fact
it belongs to them
let's give it back

how can we dance when our earth is turning?
how do we sleep while our beds are burning?
how can we dance when our earth is turning?
how do we sleep while our beds are burning?

the time has come
to say fair's fair
to pay the rent, now
to pay our share

the time has come
a fact's a fact
it belongs to them
we're gonna give it back

how can we dance when our earth is turning?
how do we sleep while our beds are burning?
