you ask me how
i've become mad now
there was a day,
i had so much say
world at my feet
life seemed to be sweet
i was admired
but i was so tired

go through the dam
lion and lamb
know what you're sayin'?
know what you're sayin'?!!!?!

things went okay,
and then one day, "pow!"
i can expound
with the new words found
if reasons gone,
how do i live on?
because i know
which way i must go

where can i go,
now that i know
time has gone by?
time has gone by


isn't that the madman,
running through the fields?
isn't that the madman?
wonder how he feels...

you look at me,
what do you see now?
is it so bad,
or am i just sad?
are you in doubt?
there is a way out
i've seen the crack
i cannot come back

i'm not afraid
sticks out a way
into the tide
be by my side

isn't that the madman,
running through the fields?
isn't that the madman?
wonder how he feels...
(heavy breathing to fade)
