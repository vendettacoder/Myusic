must have lived so long with covered eyes
but when did you say goodbye?
i'm only just waking up

to all the joy that you've outgrown
memories i can't break
alone, jealous and stoned

idle kids with idle hearts
some of them went too far
some still waiting there

sitting at home, what am i doing?
boy waitng by the phone
alone, jealous and stoned

i waited for you
i waited for you
i always waited for you

can't have been too late 'cause i was still warm 
fighting off heavy eyes
still thinking that you would call

echoing words, voices, thoughts
remembering that you forgot
and i was just hanging out

sitting at home, what am i doing?
a boy waitng by the phone
alone, jealous and stoned

i waited for you
i waited for you
i always waited for you

i waited for you
i waited for you
i always waited for you
