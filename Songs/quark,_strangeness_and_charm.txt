einstein was not a handsome fellow
nobody ever called him al
he had a long moustache to pull on, it was yellow
i don't believe he ever had a girl
one thing he missed out in his theory
of time and space and relativity
is something that makes it very clear
he was never gonna score like you and me
he didn't know about
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm 

i had a dangerous liaison
to have been found out would've been a disgrace
we had to rendezvous some days on
the corner of an undiscovered place
we got sick of chat chat chatter
and the look upon everybody's face
but all that doesn't not anti-matter now
we've found ourselves a black hole out in space
and we're talking about
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm

copernicus had those renaissance ladies
crazy about his telescope
and galileo had a name that made his
reputation higher than his hopes
did none of those astronomers discover
while they were staring out into the dark
that what a lady looks for in her lover
is charm, strangeness and quark
and we're talking about
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm
