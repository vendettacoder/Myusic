wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
put them in a bottle and
across the seas they'll stay

speak not of misfortunes
speak not of your woes
just steal yourself a holiday
crouching by the door

ride and sway to music's pain
searing with the sides
caress it with a lover's touch
for it shall be your bride

wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay

slash the golden whip, it slaps
across the lover's sides
the earth trembles without remorse
preparing for to die

salty ocean waves and sprays
come crashing to the shore
bullies kick and kill young loves
down on barroom floors

wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay

violence echoes through the land
in heart of every man
the knife stabs existent wounds
pulse runs through matted hair

the gleaming knife cuts early
through the midnight air
cutting entrails in its path
blood runs without care

excrement filters through the brain
hatred bends the spine
filth covers the body pores
to be cleansed by dying time

wrap your troubles in dreams
send them all away
put them in a bottle
and across the seas they'll stay
