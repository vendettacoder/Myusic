he would see faces in movies, on tv, in magazines, and in books
he thought that some of these faces might be right for him, and that through the years, by keeping an ideal facial structure fixed in his mind, or somewhere in the back of his mind, that he might, by force of will, cause his face to approach those of his ideal
the change would be very subtle
it might take ten years or so
gradually his face would change its shape
a more hooked nose, wider, thinner lips, beady eyes, a larger forehead

he imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people
they had also molded their faces according to some ideal
maybe they imagined that their new face would better suit their personality
or maybe they imagined that their personality would be forced to change to fit the new appearance
this is why first impressions are often correct

although some people might have made mistakes
they may have arrived at an appearance that bears no relationship to them
they may have picked an ideal appearance based on some childish whim, or momentary impulse
some may have gotten halfway there, and then changed their minds

he wonders if he, too, might have made a similar mistake
