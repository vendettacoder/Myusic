open your eyes and see my face
slow down for me in this dirty rat race
you could be fat, you could be thin
wake up with me in a in the raddisson
it's two for one or one for free
get it now cos it's a freebie
one, two, three, four
i'm the one that you adore

99 cents

i'm not crazy about money, but
i like what it can do
shopping is a cultural activity
in this worlds nothings for free
buy a book or buy a car
look what a stud you are
its not the what, its more the where,
who you know and how

99 cents
luxury, the income tax of vanity

supermarket shoppers all over the world
it's not as cheap as it may look
rob you blind cos i'm a crook
read all about it in john pilgers book

rattrap, i see a rat trap
but the cheese i want the sleaze, sleaze sleaze so
jimmy up the street singing something great to the beat
goody goody boy, got you back in town
gotta go gotta go
gotta go gotta go
where is what with who and how
you want it fast you want it now
give it to me right now high and low
fun and free got loads of dough
life is fast life is cheap
got nothing to do but hang in the street
where is what with who and how
you want it fast you want it now

99 cents chorus
