wheel gull spin and glide ... you've got no place to hide
'cause you don't need one
all along the lee shore shells lie scattered in my sin
winking up like shining eyes at me, from the sea
here is one like sunrise older than you know
it's still lying there where some careless wave
forgot it long ago
when i awoke this morning
dove beneath my floating home
down below her graceful side
in the turning tide
to watch the sea fish roam
and there i heard a story
from the sailors of the sandra marie
there's another isle a days' run away from here
it's empty and free
from here to venezuela nothing more to see
than a hundred thousand islands
flung like jewels upon the sea
for you and me
sunset smells of dinner
women are calling at me to end my tales
but perhaps i'll see you the next quiet place
i furl my sails
