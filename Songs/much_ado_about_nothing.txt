trying to write some poetry and getting nowhere fast
thought i'd better try and write a song
think i'll write a tune for it tomorrow afternoon
cause, maybe i can't stay awake that long

i want to say so much to you
but i don't know what to say
i hope you're understanding what i mean
cause you're all playing nowhere games
with one anothers lives
while
some of us are following a dream

we've all got our very own problems
and we've got to work them out for ourselves

and if you think that i'm not where it's at
then you're dead right
cause i can't tell you what's inside my head
but even if i could
it wouldn't help you much at all
so
maybe you should
find yourself instead

i haven't got a lot to say
so i think i'll finish now
it's been so nice to sing a song for you
i hope that someone somewhere
will dig this little song
it's really got a lot to say to you

we've all got our very own problems
and we've got to work them out for ourselves.
