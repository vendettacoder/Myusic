buenas tardes amigo 
hola, my good friend 
cinco de mayo's on tuesday 
and i hoped we'd see each other again 

you killed my brother last winter 
you shot him three times in the back 
in the night i still hear mama weeping 
oh mama, still dresses in black 

i looked at every fiesta 
for you i wanted to greet 
maybe i'd sell you a chicken 
with poison interlaced with the meat 

you... you look like my brother 
mama loved him the best 
he was head honcho with the ladies 
mama always said he was blessed 

the village all gathered around him 
they couldn't believe what they saw 
i said it was you that had killed him 
and that i'd find you and upstand the law 

the people of the village believed me 
mama... she wanted revenge 
i told her i'd see that she was honored 
i'd find you and put you to death 

so now... now that i've found you 
on this such a joyous day 
i tell you it was me who killed him 
but the truth i'll never have to say 

buenas tardes amigo

cinco de mayo's on tuesday 
and i hoped we'd see each other again

i hoped we'd see each other again
