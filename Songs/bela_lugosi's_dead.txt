white on white translucent black capes
back on the rack
bela lugosi's dead
the bats have left the bell tower
the victims have been bled
red velvet lines the black box

bela lugosi's dead
bela lugosi's dead

undead undead undead
undead undead undead

the virginal brides file past his tomb
strewn with time's dead flowers
bereft in deathly bloom
alone in a darkened room
the count 

bela lugosi's dead
bela lugosi's dead
bela lugosi's dead
undead undead undead 
undead undead undead 
undead

oh bela
bela's undead
oh bela
bela's undead
bela's undead
oh bela
bela's undead
oh bela

undead
