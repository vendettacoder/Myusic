there's a red house over yonder
that's where my baby stays
lord, there's a red house over yonder, baby
oh, that's where my baby stays
i ain't been home to see my baby
in ninety-nine and one half days

wait a minute, something's wrong here
the key won't unlock this door
wait a minute, something's wrong
lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door, something's going wrong here
i have a bad, bad feeling
my baby don't live here no more
that's alright, i still got my guitar
look out, now

well, i might as well uh, go on back down
way back upon the hill
lord, i might as well go back over yonder
way back yonder 'cross the hill
guess if my baby don't love me no more
i know her sister will
