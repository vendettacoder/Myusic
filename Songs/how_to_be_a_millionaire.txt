i've seen the future, i can't afford it
tell me the truth sir, someone just bought it
say mr. whispers! here come the click of dice
roulette and blackjacks - gonna build us a paradise
larger than life and twice as ugly
if we have to live there, you'll have to drug me

maybe these luxuries can only compensate
for all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate

so tell me
tell me! tell me! how to be a millionaire
tell me! tell me! how to be a millionaire!
millionaire! billionaire! trillionaire!

hardly surprising if you might consider
loyalties go to the highest of bidders
what's my opinion? i'd give you ten to one
give me a million, a franchise on fun
but there are millions who often get nowhere
and there's just one secret i think you should share

maybe these luxuries can only compensate
for all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate

so tell me
tell me! tell me! how to be a millionaire
tell me! tell me! how to be a millionaire!
who wants to be millionaire?

i do! - i don't! - i do!
who wants to be millionaire?
i do! - i don't!

i've seen the future and i can't afford it
