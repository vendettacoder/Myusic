i was traveling up the mountains one day
and suddenly i heard...
a voice come to i an'say'ay
behold i come come quickly
to pay every man
acording the work shall be here

(chorus)
and i know....dat it was the voice
the voice of the most i....

behold...i come quickly (hear what he say to one an'all
behold
behold...i come quickly (can yu hear dis is culture)

this world is like a mirror
reflected in what yu dooooo
and if yu face it smiling
will smile right back to yu...
so do one to others
as yu will'ave them too
so dat your days
will be many many ears much longer

(chorus)
(chorus)
and i know....dat it was the voice
the voice of the most i....
should behold
behold...i come quickly
