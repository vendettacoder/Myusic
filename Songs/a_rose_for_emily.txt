the summer is here at last, the sky is overcast and no one brings a rose for emily
she watches her flowers grow while lovers come and go to give each other roses from her tree
but not a rose for emily

emily, can't you see (how the sun is shining again) there's nothing you can do?
there's loving everywhere but none for you

her roses are fading now, she keeps her pride somehow, that's all she has protecting her from pain
and as the years go by she will grow old and die, the roses in her garden fade away
not one left for her grave, not a rose for emily
