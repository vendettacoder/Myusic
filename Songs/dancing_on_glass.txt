with your mouth around the bottle -- then you smash it on the hearth 
reach out for another one -- don't look back on the past 
a chair through the window --  then through the looking glass 
the crystal splinters shimmer -- bathe the pavement in moon-dust 

laughing in the crimson rain -- we feel no pain 
with shards in our soles we'll dance again and again 
oh again and again amidst the laughter in the crimson rain 

with your mouth around the bottle -- then you smash it on the hearth 
forget tomorrow's mess -- because right now is the best... 
i guess we're dancing on glass...
