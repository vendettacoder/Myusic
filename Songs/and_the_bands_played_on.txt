just before dawn in the cold light
we came out of the night
a great expectation from the man who ran the show
will it rain, will it snow, will it shine, we don't know
are there clouds up in the sky

we sat in the sun, woah-oh-oh
and the bands played on
and the bands played on
and the bands played on

see the people, feel the power
there was sixty thousand there
just like thunder the crowds began to roar
where you there, did ya know, did ya see all the show
there was magic in the air

we sat in the sun woah-oh-oh
and the bands played on
and the bands played on
and the bands played on

see the rainbow shining brightly
shooting rockets to the sky
making music and it rolled on through the night
you could hear on the air rock n' roll everywhere
we were strangers in the night

we sat in the sun woah-oh-oh
and the bands played on
and the bands played on
and the bands played on
and the bands played on
and the bands played on
