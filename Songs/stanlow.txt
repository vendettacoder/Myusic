eternally
this field remains
stanlow

no heart or head or mind
no season could erase
we set you down
to care for us
stanlow

a vision fading fast
a million hearts to one
so restrained
she turns away
stanlow

i've seen her face in every day
the same routine along the way
tonight in the rain
alone

and then again it's been so long
since one single promise kept
all to say to
reason
we wanted a heart
to say what we want to

a morning comes just as it left
a warmer feeling seldom owned
and tonight
all i see
alone
and as she turned we always knew
that her heart was never there
