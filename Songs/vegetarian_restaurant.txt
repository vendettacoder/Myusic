you recall when he hated me
and pretended that he didn't see
and he glanced a cast in your direction
and you did it for your own protection

like the way that you shell the peas
only wish you were shelling me
like the way that you dance when you're in the kitchen
bodies rockin' and your moves are bitchin'

been a regular for so long
but you treat me like there's something wrong
when i let you know you are looking lovely
tell me is it really awful of me

got the touch when you're making tea, yeah
only wish that you'd taken me
ooh like spring time takes the winter
the only thing i ever get is splinters

from your chair in your vegetarian restaurant
ooh your vegetarian restaurant
your everywhere in your vegetarian restaurant
ooh your vegetarian restaurant

don't you know i'm dying deep inside
this restaurant is all i want
so keep it all beside, yeah

i don't cry a lot, it's true
when i do, i do it over you
there's times i can't believe you're even human
sweet and modest and as unassuming
as the tableware in your vegetarian restaurant
ooh your vegetarian restaurant
