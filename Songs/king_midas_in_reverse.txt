if you could only see me
i know exactly where i am
you wouldn't want to be me
oh, i can assure you of that

i'm not the guy to run with
'cause i'll throw you off the line
i'll break you and destroy you
given time

he's king midas with a curse
he's king midas in reverse
he's king midas with a curse
he's king midas in reverse

it's plain to see it's hopeless
going on the way we are
so even though i'll lose you
you'd be better off by far

he's not the man to hold your trust
everything he touches turns to dust
in his hands
nothing he can do is right
he'd even like to sleep at night
but he can't

(all he touches turns to dust)
(all he touches turns to dust)
(all he touches turns to dust)
(all he touches turns to dust)

i wish someone would find me
and help me gain control
before i lose my reason
and my soul

he's king midas with a curse
he's king midas in reverse
he's king midas with a curse
he's king midas in reverse

he's king midas with a curse
he's king midas in reverse
he's king midas with a curse
he's king midas in reverse
