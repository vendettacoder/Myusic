valley's deep and the mountain's so high
if you want to see god you've got to move on the other side
you stand up there with your head in the clouds
don't try to fly you know you might not come down
don't try to fly, dear god, you might not come down

jesus came down from heaven to earth
the people said it was a virgin birth
jesus came down from heaven to earth
the people said it was a virgin birth
the people said it was a virgin birth

he told great stories of the lord
and said he was the saviour of us all
he told great stories of the lord
and said he was the saviour of us all
and said he was the saviour of us all

for this we killed him, nailed him up high
he rose again as if to ask us why
then he ascended into the sky
as if to say in god alone you soar
as if to say in god alone we fly

valley's deep and the mountain's so high
if you want to see god you've got to move on the other side
you stand up there with your head in the clouds
don't try to fly you know you might not come down
don't try to fly, dear god, you might not come down
