birds flying high, you know how i feel
sun in the sky, you know how i feel
reeds drifting on by, you know how i feel
it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life, for me
and i'm feeling good

fish in the sea, you know how i feel
river running free, you know how i feel
blossom in the trees, you know how i feel
it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life, for me
and i'm feeling good

dragonflies all out in the sun
you know what i mean, don't you know
butterflies are all having fun, you know what i mean
sleep in peace, when the day is done
and this old world is a new world and a bold world, for me

stars when you shine, you know how i feel
scent of the pine, you know how i feel
yeah freedom is my life, and you know how i feel
it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life, for me
and i'm feeling good

ooooh

(feeling good)
