can't you see i'm easily bothered by persistence?
one step from lashing out at you
you want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
i've got more friends like you, what do i do?

is there no standard anymore?
what it takes who i am where i've been belong
you can't be something you're not
be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me
a lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of time

re-spect, walk
what do you say?
re-spect, walk
are you talkin' to me?
are you talkin' to me?

run your mouth when i'm not around, it's easy to achieve
you cry to weak friends that sympathize
can you hear the violins playing your song?
those same friends tell me your every word

is there no standard anymore?
what it takes who i am where i've been belong
you can't be something you're not
be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me
a lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of time

re-spect, walk
what do you say?
re-spect, walk
are you talkin' to me?

re-spect, walk
what do you say?
re-spect, walk
are you talkin' to me?
are you talkin' to me?

re-spect, walk
what do you say?

are you talkin' to me?

re-spect, walk
