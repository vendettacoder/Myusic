i look at her and she looks at me
in her eyes i see the sea
i can't see what she sees in a man like me
she says she loves me
her eyes
her eyes
her eyes are a blue million miles
far as i can see
she loves me
her eyes
her eyes
her eyes are a blue million miles
far as i can see
she loves me
i look at her and she looks at me
in her eyes i see the sea
i can't see what she sees in a man like me
she says she loves me
her eyes
her eyes
her eyes are a blue million miles
