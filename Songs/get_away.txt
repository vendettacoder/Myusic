break it down
and then break it up again
me and my guitar
drowning down and down and down
not even the pain kicks in
tell me when the pain kicks in

oh i can't get away
oh i can't get away
oh i can't get away
no i can't get away

panoramic view
that's one thing i won't do
no shouted abuse
from the corner of my mind
not even the pain kicks in
tell me when the pain kicks in

oh i can't get away
oh i can't get away
oh i can't get away
no i can't get away

summer sun says get out more, i need you
i want to but i can't get this feeling off my mind
i want to, i need to

i can't get away
i can't get away
i can't get away
no i can't get away

summer sun says get out more, i need you
i want to but i can't get this feeling off my mind
i want to, i need to
