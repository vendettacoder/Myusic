if my words did glow
with the gold of sunshine
and my tunes
were played
on the harp unstrung
would you hear my voice
come through the music
would you hold it near
as it were your own?

it's a hand-me-down
the thoughts are broken
perhaps they're better
left unsung
i don't know
don't really care
let there be songs
to fill the air

ripple in still water
when there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow

reach out your hand
if your cup be empty
if your cup is full
may it be again
let it be known
there is a fountain
that was not made
by the hands of men

there is a road
no simple highway
between the dawn
and the dark of night
and if you go
no one may follow
that path is for
your steps alone

ripple in still water
when there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow

you who choose
to lead must follow
but if you fall
you fall alone
if you should stand
then who's to guide you?
if i knew the way
i would take you home
