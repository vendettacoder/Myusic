me and my annette, we was as fond as we could be 
we was set to marry in october '33 
i set my sights to courtin' her, as fine as she could be 
i never ever noticed her best friend marilee

took a job at the saw mill and i bought my girl a ring 
had a pre-wedding party, close friends and family 
everything was fine, eatin' homemade ice cream 
i swear i never noticed maid of honor marilee 

and my sweet annette was left standing at the altar
my sweet annette was left standing at the altar

marilee was taken ill, it was several miles from home 
back then it wasn't fittin' for a girl to leave alone 
sweet annette, she asked me to walk her to the door 
as innocent as children back before the war 

and my sweet annette was left standing at the altar
my sweet annette was left standing at the altar 

lord have mercy for what we done
lord have mercy when two people get alone 
neither one of us had done anything like that, you see 
by the next sunset, i had eloped with marilee
by the next sunset, i had eloped with marilee
by the next sunset, i had eloped with marilee

my sweet annette was left standing at the altar
