you'd better run, you'd better run
you'd better run from the devil's gun
the race is on, the race is on
babe, you'd better run from the devil's gun

strange things happen if you stay
the devil will catch you on any way
he'll seek you here, he'll seek you there
the devil will seek you everywhere

ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha....

and when he finds you, soon find out
the devil's fire just won't go out
it burns you up from head to toe
the devil's grip just won't let go

ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha....
