here comes my darling
saying hello you
hey why you look so worried
what's so wrong with you
i felt something evil
lying in my room
it makes me really scared
don't you feel it too

i know, it don't really matter
does it really matter
if we go insane, my darling
do we always stick together
does it really matter
if we go insane, my darling

you said you saw shooting
on a market square
since when i have been dull
to see blood in everywhere
this time man was you uncle
you wonder what went wrong
he always looked so harmless walking

i know ...
