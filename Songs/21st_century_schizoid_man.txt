cat's foot, iron claw
neurosurgeons scream for more
at paranoia's poison door
twenty-first century schizoid man

blood rack, barbed wire
politicians' funeral pyre
innocents raped with napalm fire
twenty-first century schizoid man

death seed, blind man's greed
poets' starving children bleed
nothing he's got he really needs
twenty-first century schizoid man
