chorus:
i like the feelin' i get
when i'm ridin' in a jet
say i'm goin' places
i like the feelin' i get
when i'm ridin' in a jet
say i'm goin' places

i want to go
to a different land
try my best
to understand
the different traditions
and customs
that people have

the world is bigger
than this ole town
i wanna get my feet up
off the ground
i've saved up my money
and i'm leavin' here today
'cause....

chorus:
i like the feelin' i get
when i'm ridin' in a jet
say i'm goin' places

i want to get
a first class seat
climbing to a high of forty feet
it don't take long
to get where you wanna go

i'm gonna have myself a ball
this ole world i wanna see it all
i got my clothes packed
and i'm leaving right away

(chorus)
