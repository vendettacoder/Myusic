i wish i had one good reason why
i should stay
how'd i get myself
into this place?

i wish had qualities like
sympathy
fidelity
sobriety
sincerity
humility
instead i got lunacy
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

i wish i could fit myself in my pocket
and tie myself to a rocket
and send myself to outer space
i wish i had a different face
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

i wish i had one good reason why
i should stay
how'd i get myself
into this place?

i wish my life was a little less seedy
why am i always so greedy?
wish i looked just like cheryl tweedy
i know i never will
i know i never will
i wish my life was not so boring
every weekend four to the flooring
don't get me started on monday morning
get with the other girl
get with the other girl

i wish i had one good reason why
i should stay
how'd i get myself
into this place?

i wish i could apologise
be dignified
wish i could look you in the eye
and tell you that i never lie
and wish that i could stop the cries
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

don't wake me up today
under my duvet's
where i wanna stay
don't wanna come out to play
doesn't matter what you say anyway

i wish my life was a little less seedy
why am i always so greedy?
wish i looked just like cheryl tweedy
i know i never will
i know i never will
i wish my life was not so boring
every weekend four to the flooring
don't get me started on monday morning
get with the other girl
get with the other girl

i wish i didn't smoke so many cigarettes
another programme on antiques on the tv set
wish i had blonde hair
wish i had green eyes

so many things about myself that i despise
(i wish my life was a little less seedy)
so many things about my life that i despise
(i wish my life was a little less seedy)
so many things that i despise
(i wish my life was a little less seedy)
so many things that i despise

helps that i was in this long, dark tunnel
helps that i was in this long, dark tunnel
helps that i was in this long, dark tunnel
helps that i was in this long, dark tunnel
