we can be together
ah you and me
we should be together
we are all outlaws in the eyes of america
in order to survive we steal cheat lie forge fred hide and deal
we are obscene lawless hideous dangerous dirty violent and young
but we should be together
come on all you people standing around
our life's too fine to let it die and
we can be together
all your private property is
target for your enemy
and your enemy is
we
we are forces of chaos and anarchy
everything they say we are we are
and we are very
proud of ourselves
up against the wall
up against the wall fred (motherfucker)
tear down the walls
tear down the walls
come on now together
get it on together
everybody together
we should be together
we should be together my friends
we can be together
we will be
we must begin here and now
a new continent of earth and fire
come on now gettin higher and higher
tear down the walls
tear down the walls
tear down the walls
won't you try
