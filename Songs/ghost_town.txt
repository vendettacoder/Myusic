this town is coming like a ghost town
all the clubs have been closed down
this place is coming like a ghost town
bands won't play no more
too much fighting on the dance floor

do you remember the good old days
before the ghost town?
we danced and sang
and the music played inna de boomtown

this town is coming like a ghost town
why must the youth fight against themselves?
government leaving the youth on the shelf
this place is coming like a ghost town
no job to be found in this country
can't go on no more
the people getting angry

this town is coming like a ghost town
this town is coming like a ghost town
this town is coming like a ghost town
this town is coming like a ghost town
