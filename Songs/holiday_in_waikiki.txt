i won a competition in a little column in my local paper
so i packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper
i sailed to hawaii in the u.s.a.
i'm just an english boy who won a holiday in waikiki

i didn't realize it was commercialized when i unpacked my cases
because a genuine hawaii ukulele cost me thirty guineas
and even when i'm swimming, i have to pay
i'm just an english boy who won a holiday in waikiki
oh yeah, yeah!

across the coral sands, i saw a hula hula dancer looking pretty
i asked her where she came from and she said to me "i come from new york city
and my mother is italian and my dad's a greek"
i'm just an english boy who won a holiday in waikiki

it's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to kona
and in a little shack they had a little sign that said "coca cola"
and even all the grass skirts were pvc
i'm just an english boy who won a holiday in waikiki
oh yeah, yeah!
