people stared at the makeup on his face
laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
the boy in the bright blue jeans
jumped up on the stage
lady stardust sang songs
of darkness and disgrace

and he was all right, the band was all together
yes, he was all right, the song went on forever
yes, he was awful nice
really quite out of sight
and he sang all night long

femme fatales emerged from shadows
to watch this creature fair
boys stood upon their chairs
to make their point of view
i smiled sadly for a love i could not obey
lady stardust sang songs
of darkness and dismay

and he was all right, the band was all together
yes, he was all right, his song went on forever
and he was awful nice
really quite paradise
and he sang all night long

oh, how i sighed when they asked if i knew his name

oh there was all right, the band was all together
yes, he was all right, and his song went on forever
he was awful nice
really quite paradise
he sang all night long
