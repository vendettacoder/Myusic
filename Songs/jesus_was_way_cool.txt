jesus was way cool
everybody liked jesus
everybody wanted to hang out with him
anything he wanted to do, he did
he turned water into wine
and if he wanted to
he could have turned wheat into marijuana
or sugar into cocaine
or vitamin pills into amphetamines

he walked on the water
and swam on the land
he would tell these stories
and people would listen
he was really cool

if you were blind or lame
you just went to jesus
and he would put his hands on you
and you would be healed
that's so cool

he could've played guitar better than hendrix
he could've told the future
he could've baked the most delicious cake in the world
he could've scored more goals than wayne gretzky
he could've danced better than barishnikov
jesus could have been funnier than any comedian you can think of
jesus was way cool

he told people to eat his body and drink his blood
that's so cool
jesus was so cool
but then some people got jealous of how cool he was
so they killed him
but then he rose from the dead
he rose from the dead, danced around
then went up to heaven
i mean, that's so cool
jesus was way cool

no wonder there are so many christians
