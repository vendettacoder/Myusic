a millionaire, i'm a young money millionaire
tougher than nigerian hair
my criteria compared to your career, this isn't fair
i'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
through the pencil and leak
on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'cause i don't write shit, 'cause i ain't got time
'cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
and the almighty power of that ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper
sister, brother, son, daughter, father, motherfucka, coppa
got the maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
tell the coppa's, ha-ha-ha-ha
you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
i go by them goon rules
if you can't beat 'em, then you prop 'em
you can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
you can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
you pop em, 'cause we pop 'em like orville redenbacher

motherfucka, i'm ill...yeah

sicilian bitch with long hair and coke in her derriere

ya knew that true the swallow
and i be the shit, now you got loose bowels
i don't owe you like two vowels
but i would like you to pay me by the hour, ha-ha
and i'd rather be pushin' flowers
than to be in the pen sharin' showers
tony told us this world was ours
and the bible told every girl was sour
don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
call me mr. carter or mr. lawn mower

even gwen stefani said she couldn't doubt me
motherfucka, i say life ain't shit without me
chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
i do what i do, and you do what you can do about it
bitch, i can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
