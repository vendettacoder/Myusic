they say that richard cory owns one-half of this whole town
with political connections to spread his wealth around
born into society, a banker's only child
he had everything a man could want, power, grace and style

but i work in his factory
and i curse the life i'm living
and i curse my poverty
and i wish that i could be
oh, i wish that i could be
oh, i wish that i could be richard cory

the papers print his pictures almost everywhere he goes
richard cory at the opera, richard cory at a show
and the rumours of his parties and the orgies on his yacht
oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got

but i work in his factory
and i curse the life i'm living
and i curse my poverty
and i wish that i could be
oh, i wish that i could be
oh, i wish that i could be richard cory

he freely gave to charity, he had the common touch
and they were grateful for his patronage and they thanked him very much
so my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
"richard cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head."

but i work in his factory
and i curse the life i'm living
and i curse my poverty
and i wish that i could be
oh, i wish that i could be
oh, i wish that i could be richard cory
