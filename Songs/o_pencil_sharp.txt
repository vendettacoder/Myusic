o' pencil sharp, pencil dull 
pencil drag, pencil pull, 
gonna pencil poke ya' to the floor 
gonna pencil fuck, gonna pencil whore,

o' pencil vulture, pencil dove 
pencil kisses, pencil love, 
pencil drop, down from above 
spittin' pencil bullets pencil slugs... 

yeah... 

o' pencil now, pencil then 
long before ya had a pen, 
gonna stab and stick man, gonna pencil gore, 
o' pencil get the response, the one he looking for 

to erase is of no avail, pointy pencil will prevail, 
slippery the pencil slide, swiftly the pencil sail. 

c'mon won't ya pencil me...
