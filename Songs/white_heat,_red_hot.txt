the father's son, thy kingdom come, electric ecstasy
deliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary
lead us all into the arena, magnificent in death
well, let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step

white heat, red hot
burns deep, white heat's hot

the fury songs, venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy
an overture, forever more, to senseless victories
give to us this day of glory the power and the kill
so we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of

white heat, red hot
burns deep, white heat's hot
burns a lot

who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall
the few who stand to take command forever and ever are men

prepare to fight, unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill
to slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill
the centuries of dedication inherited at last
from years of solar gladiation can only end in

white heat, red hot
burns deep, white heat's hot
burns a lot

who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall
the few who stand to take command forever and ever are men

white heat
red hot
white heat
red hot
