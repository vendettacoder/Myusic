here comes the water

all i knew
all i believed
are crumbling images
that no longer comfort me

scramble to
reach higher ground
order and sanity
or something to comfort me

take what is mine
hold what is mine
suffocate what is mine
bury what's mine
soon the water will come
and claim what is mine
i must leave it behind
and climb to a new place now

this ground is not the rock i thought it to be

thought i was high
thought i was free
thought i was there
divine destiny

i was wrong
this changes everything

running away
running away
now i'm running away
running away
now i'm running away
running away
i'm running away
running away

i will take what is mine
hold what is mine
suffocate what is mine
bury what's mine
soon the water will come
and claim what is mine
i must leave it behind
and climb to a new place

water's rising up on me
said the water is rising up on me
thought the sun would come deliver me
but the truth has come to punish me instead

oh yeah

grounds break down right under me
cleanse and purge me
in the water
