mother, don't you recognize your son? 
coming home, 'cause i failed you mother
i'll be there in the morning
if you'll have me back
the rent up here is much too high 
for a room without a tap
i'll be early in the morning 
and i'll find my way back home
back home bad 'n' ruin
with my tail between my legs
tail between my legs
and i'll be so tired

i'll be early tomorrow morning 
and i'll fall down off my plane
don't be embarrassed mother
by your ugly worn-out son
your ugly worn-out son.

mother, you won't recognize me now
mother, you won't recognize me now
mother, you won't recognize me now

and i'll be down on cannon street
passport in my hand
should you not recognize me
i've heavily made-up my eyes
momma, you won't recognize me now
brother, you won't recognize me now
sister, you won't recognize me now
mother, you won't recognize me now

so mother when you've seen me
don't forget i'm your boy too
i know my brother has done you proud
he's one foot in the grave
mother don't you recognize me now?

i'm a burglar in the first degree
but it don't seem to worry me
i'll be so tired, so tired
i'll be so tired, so tired

so tired
