there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for

ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
and she's buying a stairway to heaven

there's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

ooh it makes me wonder
ooh it makes me wonder

there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking

ooh it makes me wonder
ooh it really makes me wonder

and it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter

oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-ho-oh

if there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean for the may queen
yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
there's still time to change the road you're on

and it makes me wonder
oh-oh-ho

your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

and as we wind on down the road
our shadow's taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one and one is all, yeah
to be a rock and not to roll

and she's buying a stairway to heaven
