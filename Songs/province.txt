ooh, ooh, ooh

suddenly, all your history's ablaze
try to breathe as the world disintegrates
just like autumn leaves, we're in for change
holding tenderly to what remains

and all your memories are as precious as gold
and all the honey and the fire which you stole
have you running through all your red-cheeked days
shaking loose these souls from their sacred hiding space

hold your heart courageously
as we walk into this dark place
stand steadfast erect and see
that love is the province of the brave

pushed under this expanse of bursting stars
let this burning brightly illuminate the where we are
in this hollow that lovers' voices occupy
let it follow that we let it free, let it fly

breaking open the walls of this cage
intoxicated, oh so amazed
much like falcons tumbling from the heights at play
conjoined, talons engaged

hold these hearts courageously
as we walk into this dark place
stand steadfast beside me and see
that love is the province of the brave
