from distant star to this here bar
the me, the you, where are we now?
hooray, the blues of everyone
allison

keeps a smile around a while
he took no fright and jettisoned
we'll go tonight to hear him tell
oh well

allison
allison

and when the planets hit the sun
i saw the face of allison

allison
allison
allison
