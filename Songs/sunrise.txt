i was born in londonderry
i was born in derry city too
oh what a special child
to see such things and still to smile
i knew that there was something wrong
but i kept my head down and carried on

i grew up in enniskillen
i grew up in inis ceathlain too
oh what a clever boy
to watch your hometown be destroyed
i knew that i would not stay long
so i kept my head down and carried on

who cares where national borders lie?
who cares whose laws you're governed by?
who cares what name you call a town?
who'll care when you're six feet beneath the ground?

from the corner of my eye
a hint of blue in the black sky
a ray of hope, a beam of light
an end to thirty years of night
the church-bells ring, the children sing
"what is this strange and beautiful thing?"
it's the sunrise
can you see the sunrise?
i can see the sunrise
it's the sun rising
