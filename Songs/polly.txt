polly wants a cracker
think i should get off her first
think she wants some water
to put out the blow torch

isn't me, have a seed
let me clip, dirty wings
let me take a ride, cut yourself
want some help, please myself
got some rope, have been told
promise you, have been true
let me take a ride, cut yourself
want some help, please myself

polly wants a cracker
maybe she would like some food
she asks me to untie her
chase would be nice for a few

isn't me, have a seed
let me clip, dirty wings
let me take a ride, cut yourself
want some help, please myself
got some rope, have been told
promise you, have been true
let me take a ride, cut yourself
want some help, please myself

polly says her back hurts
she's just as bored as me
she caught me off my guard
'mazes me the will of instinct

isn't me, have a seed
let me clip, dirty wings
let me take a ride, cut yourself
want some help, please myself
got some rope, have been told
promise you, have been true
let me take a ride, cut yourself
want some help, please myself
