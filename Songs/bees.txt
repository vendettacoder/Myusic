so sudden, the bees
they came flying
so violent, the bees
they came sly
so scary, the bees
they came wide
so wild, the bees
they came crying

they said, "i'd take my time
you take your time
please take your time"

i'd take my time
i'd take my time
you take your time
just take your time
i take my time

and if you need 'em, and if you need
the bees, the bees
the bees, the bees
the bees, the bees

and if you need 'em, or if you need
the bees, the bees
the bees, the bees
the bees, the bees

and if you need 'em, or if you need
the bees, the bees
the bees, the bees
the bees, the bees
