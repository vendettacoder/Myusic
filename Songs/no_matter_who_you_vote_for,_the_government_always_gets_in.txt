preside!.....order!.....order!
 
noises on the radio, megaphones on cars 
sermons from the street of shame, know-it-alls in bars 
posters in suburbia, experts on tv 
don't let them disturb-i-ya 
they're just the powers that be 
hey-ho! 
don't worry! nobody can win! (hey-ho! hey-ho!) 
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in 
hey-ho! 

oh great, great slumbering nation 
awake! set yourself free 
oh! smell the comforting bacon, taste the bromide tea 
and give a little chirrup as i ladle on the syrup 
promises are cheap 
let me bear your crosses, make me boss of bosses 
then you go back to sleep (ha ha ha) 
hey-ho!
 
don't worry! pop your cross in the bin (hey-ho! hey-ho!) 
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in 
hey-ho! 
hey-ho! 
hey-ho! 
hey-ho!
 
memories of a finer place in comfortable shangri-la 
then they too have their shangri-las 
shangri-la la la!

see them in the public eye oozing oily charm 
hear them all personify down on animal farm 
dog eat dog but cock and bull isms are the game
hey-ho!
 
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in.

no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in.

hey-ho! 
don't worry! pop your cross in the bin (hey-ho! hey-ho!) 
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in. 
don't worry! you know you can't win! (hey-ho! hey-ho!) 
no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in 
no matter who you vote for..............fade
