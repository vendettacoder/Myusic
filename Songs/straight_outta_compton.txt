dr. dre:
you are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

ice cube:
straight outta compton, crazy motherfucker named ice cube
from the gang called niggaz wit attitudes
when i'm called off, i got a sawed-off
squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
you too boy if you fuck with me
the police are gonna have to come and get me
off yo' ass, that's how i'm going out
for the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
mix 'em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
going off on a motherfucker like that
with a gat, that's pointed at yo' ass
so give it up smooth
ain't no telling when i'm down for a jack move
here's a murder rap to keep you dancing
with a crime record like charles manson
ak-47 is the tool
don't make me act the motherfucking fool
me, you can go toe to toe, no maybe
i'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
yo weekly, monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
that i'm down with the capital c-p-t
boy, you can't fuck with me
so when i'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
'cause ice cube is crazy as fuck
as i leave, believe i'm stomping
but when i come back boy, i'm coming straight outta compton

eazy-e and mc ren:
yo ren
(whassup?)
tell 'em where you from

mc ren:
straight outta compton, another crazy ass nigga
more punks i smoke, yo my rep gets bigger
i'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
but the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
but i don't give a fuck, i'mma make my snaps
if not from the records, from jacking or craps
just like burglary, the definition is jacking
and when illegally armed it's called packing
shoot a motherfucker in a minute
i find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
so if you're at a show in the front row
i'mma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
you'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
but that shows me slut, you're composed to
a crazy motherfucker from the street
attitude legit 'cause i'm tearing up shit
mc ren controls the automatic
for any dumb motherfucker that starts static
not a right hand 'cause i'm the hand itself
every time i pull a ak off the shelf
the security is maximum and that's a law
r-e-n spells ren but i'm raw
see, cause i'm the motherfucking villain
the definition is clear, you're the witness of a killing
that's taking place without a clue
and once you're on the scope, your ass is through
look, you might take it as a trip
but a nigga like ren is on a gangsta tip, straight outta compton

dr. dre:
eazy is his name and the boy is coming

eazy-e:
straight outta compton, is a brother that'll smother your mother
and make your sister think i love her
dangerous motherfucker raising hell
and if i ever get caught, i make bail
see i don't give a fuck, that's the problem
i see a motherfucking cop, i don't dodge him
but i'm smart, lay low, creep a while
and when i see a punk pass, i smile
to me, it's kinda funny, the attitude show a nigga driving
but don't know where the fuck he going, just rolling
looking for the one they call eazy
but here's a flash, they never seize me
ruthless, never seen like a shadow in the dark, except when i unload
you see i'll get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
give a little gust of wind and i'm jetting
but leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
so what about the bitch who got shot, fuck her
you think i give a damn about a bitch, i ain't a sucker
this is an autobiography of the e and if you ever fuck with me
you'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
word to the motherfucker, straight outta compton
