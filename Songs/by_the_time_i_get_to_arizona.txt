i'm countin' down to the day deservin' fittin' for a king 
i'm waitin' for the time when i can get to arizona
'cause my money's spent on the goddamn rent 
neither party is mine not the jackass or the elephant 
20.000 niggy niggy brothas in the corner 
of the cell block but they come from california 
population is none in the desert and sun 
wit' a gun cracker runnin' things under his thumb 
starin' hard at the postcards isn't it odd and unique? 
seein' people smile wild in the heat 
120 degree 'cause i wanna be free 
what's a smilin' face when the whole state's racist?
why want a holiday? damn it 'cause i wanna 
so what if i celebrate it standin' on a corner 
i ain't drinkin' no 40 thinkin' time wit' a nine 
until we get some land call me the trigger man 
lookin' for the governor huh he ain't lovin' ya hah
but here to trouble ya he's rubbin' ya wrong 
get the point to come along he can get to the joint 
i urinated on the state while i was kickin' this song 
yeah, he appear to be fair you sucker over there 
he try to keep it yesteryear the good ol' days 
the same ol' ways that kept us dyin' 
yes, you me myself and i indeed 
what he need is a nosebleed read between the lines
then you see the lie 
politically planned don't understand that's all she wrote 
when we see the real side that hide behind the vote 
and they can't understand why he the man 
i'm singin' 'bout a king they don't like it when i decide to mike it 
wait i'm waitin' for the date for the man who demands respect 
'cause he was great c'mon 
i'm on the one mission to get a politician to honor 
or he's a goner by the time i get to arizona 

well i got 25 days to do it if a wall in the way 
just watch me go thru it 
'cause i gotta do what i gotta do 
pe number one gets the job done 
when it's done and over was because i drove 'er 
thru all the static not stick but automatic 
that's the way it is he gotta get his
talkin' mlk 
gonna find a way 
make the state pay lookin' for the day 
hard as it seems this ain't no damn dream 
gotta know what i mean it's team against team 
catch the light beam 

so i pray i pray everyday i do and praise jah the maker 
lookin' for culture i got but not here from jamaica 
pushin' and shakin' the structure bringin' down the babylon 
hearin' the sucker that make it hard for the brown 
the hard boulevard i need now more than ever now 
who's sittin' on my freedom opressor people beater 
a piece of the pick we picked a piece of land that we deservin' now 
reparation a piece of the nation and damn he got the nerve 
another nigga they say and classify we want too much 
my people plus the nine is mine don't think i even double dutch 
here's a brother my attitude is "hit 'em hang 'em high"
i'm blowin' up the 90s started tickin' in 86 
when the blind get a mind better start fearin while we sing it now 
there will be the day we know those down and who will go go go go go...
...by the time i get to arizona...
...by the time i get to arizona...
...by the time i get to arizona...
