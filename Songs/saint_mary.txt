blanket me sweet nurse
and keep me from burnin'
i must get back
to the woods dear girls
i must get back to the woods

in the bloody elevator rising for their first cup of tea
of the day
when does sky turn into space
and air into wind?

the only things
i really need
is water, a gun, and rabbits

let me rest
my fevered cheek
upon your warm sweet bellies

in the bloody elevator going to the bright theater now
come on boys
please let me taste the clean dirt in my lungs
and moss on my back
