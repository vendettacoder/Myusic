each day i walk along this lonely street
trying to find, find a future
new pair of shoes are on my feet
cos' fashion is my only culture

nothing ever change, oh no...
nothing ever change

people say to me just be yourself
it makes no sense to follow fashion
how could i be anybody else
i don't try, i've got no reason

nothing ever change, oh no...
nothing ever change

i'm just living in a life without meaning
i walk and walk, do nothing
i'm just living in a life without feeling
i talk and talk, say nothing

nothing ever change, oh no...
nothing ever change

i walk along this same old lonely street
still trying to find, find a reason
policeman comes and smacks me in the teeth
i don't complain, it's not my function

nothing ever change, oh no...
nothing ever change

they're just living in a life without meaning
i walk and walk, do nothing
they're just playing in a life without thinking
they talk and talk, say nothing
i'm just living in a life without feeling
i walk and walk, i'm dreaming
i'm just living in a life without feeling
i talk and talk, say nothing
i'm just living in a life without meaning
i walk and walk, do nothing
