belle
the lord and i've been friends for a mighty long time
belle
leaving him has never ever really crossed my mind

(let me say just one thing)
i'd never go so far
'cause it's him no matter who you are
belle
it's you i want but it's him that i need

(i'd like to take a little minute just to say now)
belle
the laughter of the sound has quieted down
belle
the best thing we could do is have him around
(now i'm not playing, little lady)

(let me say this one thing)
i think if love could abound
my heart was lost but now it's found
belle
let's you and i let his love come down

(i'm so happy... happy about that now. say this)
seems so easy to me
to try to act naturally
let's not waste each other's time (time)

belle
he's my surprise and, lord, he's my joy (my joy, not just a toy)
belle
i know that you can understand
a little country boy (just a little country boy)

he brought me safe thus far (let me say, little lady)
through many drunken country bars
belle,let me say
he's my bright morning star
belle, belle
my bright in the morning
he's my bright in the morning
he's my everything, my everything
a drink of water
belle
he's my joy in the morning time
belle
i know you're all of these things, yeah
but he's such a brighter joy, he's such a brighter ...

jesus is my ...
he's ...
(my everything)
my everything
in the morning
in the evening
in the daytime
in the night time

he's my everything, yeah!
belle
belle, belle, belle, belle, belle ...
