there's a bluebird at my window 
i can't hear the songs he sings
all the jewels in heaven
they don't look the same to me 

i just wade the tides that turned 
till i learn to leave the past behind 

it's only lies that i'm living
it's only tears that i'm crying
it's only you that i'm losing
guess i'm doing fine

all the battlements are empty
and the moon is laying low
yellow roses in the graveyard
got no time to watch them grow

now i bade a friend farewell
i can do whatever pleases me

it's only lies that i'm living
it's only tears that i'm crying
it's only you that i'm losing
guess i'm doing fine

press my face up to the window
to see how warm it is inside
see the things that i've been missing
missing all this time

it's only lies that i'm living
it's only tears that i'm crying
it's only you that i'm losing
guess i'm doing fine
