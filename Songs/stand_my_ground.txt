i can see 
when you stay low 
nothing happens 
does it feel right? 
late at night 
things i thought i'd put behind me 
haunt my mind 

i just know there's no escape now 
once it sets its eyes on you 
but i won't run 
have to stare it in the eyes 

stand my ground 
i won't give in 
no more denying 
i've gotta face it 
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
if i don't make it, someone else will 
stand my ground 

it's all around 
getting stronger, coming closer into my world 
i can feel that it's time for me to face it 
can i take it? 

though this might just be the ending 
of the life i held so dear 
but i won't run 
there's no turning back from here 

stand my ground 
i won't give in 
no more denying 
i've gotta face it 
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
if i don't make it, someone else will 
stand my ground 

all i know for sure is that i'm trying 
i will always stand my ground 

stand my ground 
i won't give in (i won't give in) 
i won't give up (i won't give up) 
no more denying (ahh-hhhh) 
i've gotta face it 
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
if i don't make it, someone else will 

stand my ground 
i won't give in 
no more denying 
i've gotta face it 
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
if i don't make it, someone else will 
stand my ground
