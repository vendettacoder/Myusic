it came from the skies
it burst through the gates
with no mercy or disguise
with their hearts set out in flames
i know i've seen the master plan

well i'm just a man (i am just a man)
i'm not giving in
all the people understand
'cause they all fell down and prayed
i know i've seen the master plan

they've killed the president
they've killed the president

it came from the skies (it came from the skies)
in all shades of green
we can always justify
we can measure up your dreams
i know i've seen the master plan

they've killed the president
they've killed the president
they've killed the president

yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

they've killed the president
they've killed the president
they've killed the president
they've killed the president

i'm just a man
