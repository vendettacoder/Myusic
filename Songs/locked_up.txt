i'm steady tryin' to find a motive
why do what i do?
the freedom ain't gettin no closer
no matter how far i go
my car is stolen
no registration
the cops patrollin'
and now they done stop me
and i get locked up

they won't let me out
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out, nooo
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out, nooo
they won't let me out

headin' up town to rio, back with a couple keys
the corner block's on fire, undercovers dressed as fiends
makin' so much money
product's movin' fast
put away the stash 
as i sold the last bag
fucked around and got locked up

they won't let me out
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out, nooo
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out, nooo
they won't let me out

visitation no longer comes by
it seems like they forgot about me
commissary is gettin empty
my cellmates gettin food without me
can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
(move on with my life)
got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
but instead i'm here locked up

they won't let me out
they won't let me out
i'm locked up; they won't let me out, nooo
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out
they won't let me out
i'm locked up, they won't let me out, nooo
they won't let me out
