you called me last night on the telephone
and i was glad to hear from you 'cause i was all alone
you said, "it's snowing, it's snowing - god i hate this weather!"
now i walk through blizzards just to get us back together

we met in the springtime at a rock-n-roll show
it was on the  bowery when it was time to go
we kissed on the subway in the middle of the night
i held your hand, you held mine, it was the best night of my life

'cause everyone's your friend in new york city
and everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
the streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
but the best thing about new york city is you and me

statue of liberty, staten island ferry,
co-op  city, "cats" and tiffany's
central park, brooklyn bridge
the empire state where dylan lived
coney island and times square
rockefeller center
wish i was there

you wrote me a letter just the other day
said "springtime is coming soon, so why don't you come to stay?"
i packed my stuff, got on the bus, i can't believe it's true
i'm three days from new york city and i'm three days from you

'cause everyone's my friend in new york city
and everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
the streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
but the best thing about new york city is you and me

'cause everyone's my friend in new york city
and everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
the streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
but the best thing about new york city is you and me
