a white house, a white room, the program of today
lights on, switch on, your eyes are far away
the map represents you and the tape is your voice
follow all along you till you recognize the choice

i take pictures
photographic pictures

bright light

i said i'd write a letter, but i never got the time
then i'm looking to the day, i mesmerize the light
the years i spent just thinking of a moment we both knew
a second passed like an empty room, it seems it can't be true
