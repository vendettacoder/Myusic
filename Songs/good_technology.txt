we've got photographs of men on the moon
we've got water that is good for us
we've got coffee that's instantaneous
we've got buildings that are very tall
we've got cigarettes that are low in tar
we've got policemen who can tell us who we are
we can reproduce a work of art
we've got missiles can tear the world apart
good, good, good, good, good, good technology

we've got trains that run underground
aeroplanes that fly very fast
we've got music that is popular
we've got machines that sound like orchestras
we've got ability to transplant a heart
we've got freezers full of body parts
we've got computers that can find us friends
we know roughly when the world will end
good, good, good, good, good, good technology

we've got animals with transistors in
we've got pills that can make you slim
we've got factories turning frozen chickens out
we've got ovens that cook in seconds flat
we've got plastics that are indestructible
we've got deodorants that make us smell of flowers
we've got detergents to clean up the sea
we've got sounds that can tear us inside out

sometimes i wonder what it is all about
there's lots of leisure time to sit and work it out
there's a tv show i've got to see
good, good, good, good, good, good technology
good technology
