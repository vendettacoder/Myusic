waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair 
waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere 
we get buses everywhere 
waiting for a factory girl 

waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat 
waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats 
her zipper's broken down the back 
waiting for a factory girl 

waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights 
waiting for a girl we get drunk on friday night 
she's a sight for sore eyes 
waiting for a factory girl 

waiting for a girl and she's got stains all down her dress 
waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet 
she ain't come out yet 
waiting for a factory girl
