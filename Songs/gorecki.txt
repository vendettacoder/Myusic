if i should die this very moment
i wouldn't fear
for i've never known completeness
like being here
wrapped in the warmth of you
loving every breath of you
still my heart this moment
or it might burst
could we stay right here
until the end of time until the earth stops turning
wanna love you until the seas run dry
i've found the one i've waited for

all this time i've loved you
and never known your face
all this time i've missed you
and searched this human race
here is true peace
here my heart knows calm
safe in your soul
bathed in your sighs
wanna stay right here
until the end of time
'til the earth stops turning
gonna love you until the seas run dry
i've found the one i've waited for

the one i've waited for

all i've known
all i've done
all i've felt was leading to this
all i've known
all i've done
all i've felt was leading to this
wanna stay right here
'til the end of time 'till the earth stops turning
i'm gonna love you till the seas run dry
i've found the one i've waited for
the one i've waited for
the one i've waited for

wanna stay right here
'til the end of time 'till the earth stops turning
i'm gonna love you till the seas run dry
i've found the one i've waited for
the one i've waited for
the one i've waited for
