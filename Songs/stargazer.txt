high noon, oh i'd sell my soul for water
nine years worth of breakin' my back
there's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
see how he glides, why he's lighter than air
oh i see his face!

where is your star?
is it far, is it far, is it far?
when do we leave?
i believe, i believe, i believe

in the heat and the rain
with whips and chains
to see him fly
we built a tower of stone
with our flesh and bone
to see him fly
but we don't know why
now where do we go?

hot wind, moving fast across the desert
we feel that our time has arrived
the world spins, while we put his dream together
a tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
oh i see his face!

where is your star?
is it far, is it far, is it far?
when do we leave?
i believe, i believe, i believe

in the heat and the rain
with whips and chains
to see him fly
so many die
we built a tower of stone
with our flesh and bone
to see him fly
but we don't know why
now where do we go?

all eyes see the figure of the wizard
as he climbs to the top of the world
no sound, as he falls instead of rising
time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
oh i see his face!

where was your star?
was it far, was it far, was it far?
when did we leave?
we believed, we believed, we believed

in the heat and the rain
with whips and chains
to see him fly
so many die
we built a tower of stone
with our flesh and bone
to see him fly
but we don't know why
now where do we go?
