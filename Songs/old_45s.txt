dudes just step to ya with a corny line
asking for your name, saying what's your sign?
you turn around like boy quit talking to me

he could pick you up in a limousine
you'd look back like whachu mean
just worried about more important things

boys are non-committal
always in the middle
it bothers you a little
bothers you a little
why can't we be like mom &amp; dad?

you don't wanna settle
didn't you get the memo
you only get a date if you're walking in stilettos
this is enough to drive you mad

if you think romance is getting old
find an old jukebox full of 45's
pop a nickel in it and it all comes back

if you think romance is getting old
find an old jukebox full of 45's
pop a nickel in it and let it all comes back to me

if you think romance is getting old
find an old jukebox full of 45's
pop a nickel in it and dance with me

write her up, maybe out of touch
you only see schmucks
and you've really had enough
it's not adding up and you just don't understand

straight shooter, he's a straight shooter
cut to the chase and he asked if he could do her
ps he had a ring on his left hand

boys are non-committal
always in the middle
it bothers you a little
it bothers you a little
why can't we be like mom &amp; dad?

don't wanna settle
didn't you get the memo
you only get a date if you're walking in stilettos
this is enough to drive you mad

if you think romance is getting old
find an old jukebox full of 45's
pop a nickel in it and it all comes back to me

you think romance is getting a
like a jukebox full of 45's
pop a nickel in it and it all comes back to me
