thought i was lookin' good
so i cycled 'cross the neighbourhood
was invited by a skinny girl 
into her high class world

left my bicycle under the stairs
laid my coat across the kosher chairs
made my way across the crowded room
i had nothing to lose

my reception wasn't very keen
so turning on a friendly grin
stood on the table with my glass of gin
and came straight to the point

(chorus)
i was glad to come
i'll be sad to go
so while i'm here
i'll have me a real good time

(repeat)

dancing madly round the room, yeah
singing loudly and sorta' out of tune
was escorted by a friendly slag
'round the bedroom and back
wandered across to the door
missed my step and i fell on the floor.
said one word and was asked to leave
kinda' wish i was dead.

(chorus)

the skinny girl made it clear
that she only came here for the beer
the vicar simply reeked of gin
on my way home i happened to fall off my bicycle
(good party)
i was glad to come, but i was also glad to get home
