the future teaches you to be alone, the present to be afraid and cold
so if i can shoot rabbits then i can shoot fascists
bullets for your brain today, but we'll forget it all again
monuments put from pen to paper turns me into a gutless wonder

and if you tolerate this then your children will be next
and if you tolerate this then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next

gravity keeps my head down, or is it maybe shame?
at being so young and being so vain
holes in your head today, but i'm a pacifist
i've walked las ramblas but not with real intent

and if you tolerate this then your children will be next
and if you tolerate this then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next
will be next

and on the street tonight an old man plays with newspaper cuttings of his glory days

and if you tolerate this then your children will be next
and if you tolerate this then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next
