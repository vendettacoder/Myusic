now somewhere in the black mountain hills of dakota
there lived a young boy name o' rocky raccoon-a
and one day his woman ran off with another guy
hit young rocky in the eye
rocky didn't like that
he said, "i'm gonna get that boy"
so one day he walked into town
booked himself a room in the local saloon

rocky raccoon
checked into his room
only to find gideon's bible
rocky had come
equipped with a gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival

his rival, it seems
had broken his dreams
by stealing the girl of his fancy
her name was magill
and she called herself lil
but everyone knew her as nancy

now, she and her man
who called himself dan
were in the next room at the hoedown
a-rocky burst in
and grinning a grin
he said, "danny, boy, this is a showdown!"

but daniel was hot
and he drew first and shot
and rocky collapsed in the corner
aah

da-d'n da da da da da
daa-d'l da da da da da
daa-d'l da da da da da
da-da da da-da ndoo ndoo-doo-doo
dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo
dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo
doo doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
doo-doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
la-ta ndoo dloo-doo-doo

now the doctor came in
stinking of gin
and proceeded to lie on the table
he said, "rocky, you met your match"
and rocky said, "doc, it's only a scratch
and i'll be better
i'll be better, doc, as soon as i am able"

a-now rocky raccoon
he fell back in his room
only to find gideon's bible (daa da-da-da)
a-gideon checked out (poor)
and he left it no doubt (rocky)
to help with good rocky's revival (ohhh)

aah
