i'd sit alone and watch your light
my only friend through teenage nights
and ev'rything i had to know
i heard it on my radio

you gave them all those old time stars
through wars of worlds - invaded by mars
you made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
you made us feel like we could fly
radio

so don't become some background noise
a backdrop for the girls and boys
who just don't know or just don't care
and just complain when you're not there
you had your time you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio

all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo
radio ga ga
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio blah blah
radio what's new?
radio someone still loves you

we watch the shows - we watch the stars
on videos for hours and hours
we hardly need to use our ears
how music changes through the years

let's hope you never leave old friend
like all good things on you we depend
so stick around 'cause we might miss you
when we grow tired of all this visual
you had your time you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio

all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo
radio ga ga
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio goo goo
radio ga ga
all we hear is radio ga ga
radio blah blah
radio what's new?
someone still loves you

radio ga ga
radio ga ga
radio ga ga
radio

you had your time you had the power
you've yet to have your finest hour
radio
