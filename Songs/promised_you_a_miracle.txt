promised you a miracle.
belief is a beauty thing.
promises promises,
as golden days break wondering.

chance as love takes a train.
summer breeze and brilliant light.
only love she sees,
he controls on love,
love sails to a new life.

promised you a miracle.
belief is a beauty thing.
promises promises,
as golden days break wondering.

only love she sees.
he controls on love.
life mirrors a cure.
everything is possible,
with promises.
everything is possible.
oh no.

i promised you a miracle.
belief is a beauty thing.
promises promises,
as golden days break wondering.

chance reflects on them a while,
love screams so quietly.
slipping back on golden times,
breathing with sweet memories.

promised you a miracle.
belief is a beauty thing.
promises promises,
as golden days break wondering.

only love she sees.
he controls on love.
life mirrors a cure.
everything is possible in the game of life.
everything is possible.
oh no.

chance lost pearls of great price,
take care of family,
only aches for love,
love waits for fame,
in chance, in chance, they'll see.

i promised you a miracle.
belief is a beauty thing.
promises promises,
as golden days break wondering.

only love she sees.
he controls on love.
life throws a cure.
everything is possible in the game of life,
a burning dream.
you can be queen.
everything is possible
