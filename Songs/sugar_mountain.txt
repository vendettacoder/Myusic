oh, to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the coloured balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon

it's so noisy at the fair
but all your friends are there
and the candy floss you had
and your mother and your dad

oh, to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the coloured balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon

there's a girl just down the aisle
oh, to turn and see her smile
you can hear the words she wrote
as you read the hidden note

oh, to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the coloured balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon

now you're underneath the stairs
and you're givin' back some glares
to the people who you met
and it's your first cigarette

oh, to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the coloured balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon

now you say you're leavin' home
'cause you want to be alone
ain't it funny how you feel
when you're findin' out it's real?

oh, to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the coloured balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
you're leaving there too soon

oh, to live on sugar mountain
with the barkers and the coloured balloons
you can't be twenty on sugar mountain
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
