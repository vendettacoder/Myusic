lucifer sam siam cat
always sitting by your side
always by your side
that cat's something i can't explain

jennifer gentle you're a witch
you're the left side
he's the right side oh no
that cat's something i can't explain

lucifer go to sea
be a hip cat
be a ship's cat
somewhere anywhere
that cat's something i can't explain

at night prowling sifting sand
hiding around on the ground
he'll be found
when you're around
that cat's something i can't explain
