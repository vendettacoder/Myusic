there's a storm outside
and the gap between crack and thunder
crack and thunder is closing in
is closing in

the rain floods gutters 
and makes a great sound on concrete
on a flat roof
theres a boy leaning against a wall of rain
aerial held high
calling "come on thunder, come on thunder"

it's a monsoon
the rain lifts lids off cars 
spinning busses like toys
stripping them to chrome

across the bay
the waves are turning into something else
picking up fishing boats
and spewing them on the shore

the boy's hit
lit up against the sky
like a sign, like a neon sign.

then he crumples
drops into the gutter
cut strings
legs twitching,
the flood swells his clothes
and delivers him on
delivers him on

sometimes...
when i look deep in your eyes
i swear i can see your soul
sometimes...
when i look deep in your eyes
i swear i can see your soul

there's 4 new colors in the rainbow
an old man's taking polaroids
but all he captures is endless rain
endless rain
endless rain

he says listen
takes my head
puts my ear to his
and i swear i can hear the sea

sometimes...
(when i look in your eyes
i can see your soul)
i can reach your soul

sometimes...
(when i look in your eyes
i can see your soul)
i can touch your soul

sometimes...
(when i look in your eyes
i can see your soul)
i can hear your soul

sometimes...
