there's something happening here
but what it is ain't exactly clear
there's a man with a gun over there
telling me i got to beware

i think it's time we stop
children, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?

there's battle lines being drawn
and nobody's right if everybody's wrong
young people speaking their minds
getting so much resistance from behind

it's time we stop
hey, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?

what a field day for the heat
a thousand people in the street
singing songs and carrying signs
mostly saying, "hooray for our side"

it's time we stop
hey, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?

paranoia strikes deep
into your life it will creep
it starts when you're always afraid
step out of line, the men come and take you away

we better stop
hey, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?

stop
hey, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?

stop
now, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?

we better stop
children, what's that sound?
everybody look, what's going down?
