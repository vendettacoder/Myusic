go on and wring my neck
like when a rag gets wet
a little discipline
for my pet genius
my head is like lettuce
go on, dig your thumbs in
i cannot stop givin'
i'm thirty-something

sense of security
like pockets jinglin'
midlife crisis
suck ingenuity
down through the family tree

you're perfect, yes, it's true
but without me you're only you (you're only you)
your menstruating heart
it ain't bleedin' enough for two
it's a midlife crisis
it's a midlife crisis

what an inheritance
the salt and the kleenex
morbid self-attention
bending my pinky back
a little discipline
a donor by habit
a little discipline
rent an opinion

sense of security
holding blunt instrument
midlife crisis
i'm a perfectionist
and perfect is a skinned knee

you're perfect, yes, it's true
but without me you're only you (you're only you)
your menstruating heart
it ain't bleedin' enough for two

yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
ahhhh!

it's a mid-a-life crisis
it's a mid-a-life crisis

you're perfect, yes, it's true (go on and wring my neck)
(like when a rag gets wet) but without me you're only you (go on and wring my neck) 
your menstruating heart (go on and wring my neck)
(like when a rag gets wet) it ain't bleedin' enough for two

you're perfect, yes, it's true (go on and wring my neck)
(like when a rag gets wet) but without me you're only you (go on and wring my neck) (you're only you)
