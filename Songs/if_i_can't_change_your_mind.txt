tears fill up my eyes
i'm washed away with sorrow
and somewhere in my mind
i know there's no tomorrow
i see you're leaving soon
i guess you've had your fill
but if i can't change your mind
then no one will

and all throughout the years
i've never strayed from you my dear
but you suspect i'm somewhere else
you're feeling sorry for yourself
leaving with a broken heart
i love you even still
but if i can't change your mind
then no one will

even though my heart keeps breaking
don't you know that i'll be waiting
here for you
then when you return
when will you return
i hope you see i'm dedicated
look how long that i have waited
if you come back then you will find
a different person
if you change your mind

how can i explain away
something that i haven't done
and if you can't trust me now
you'll never trust in anyone
with all the crazy doubts you've got
i love you even still
but if i can't change your mind
then no one will

someday you'll see i've been true
i'll stay that way until
but if i can't change your mind
then no one will
