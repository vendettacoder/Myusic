as the sun rose up into the sky
and all i could hear was bird-song
and the hackneyed tongues of radio one
i knew something was wrong

and as i lay and tried to remember
the tightly closed eye
i felt soft warm fingers trace a course
from the small of my back to the inside thigh

bite your lip
pretend you're asleep
and hold your breath
count to ten
and when you open your eyes just hope
you're back in bed
with your girlfriend again

i recall a bottle of vodka being
passed among friends
a strange party piece with a swiss army knife
just me and your girlfriend or is she your wife?

i know my bedroom's white and this one's green
with posters of bands i hate
and there's a whiff of petunia and i know

it's not me
an air of health and de-caf tea
and as a breast or two squash into my back
a rambling yawn floats over

it smacks me in the ghost white open mouth
just what this farce is all about
i'm in bed with your best friend
i've never done this sort of thing before
and i swear i was drunk
and i can't believe the depths to which i've sunk

now i know it's been hard
and i know i've been weak
but with your job in the bills
you can't blame me
it's just one of those things
we'll see it through
from this second on it's
just me and you

and as the chirrups of cox assault my ears
your rambling hand takes over

i contemplate murder and the scene of the crime
but the guilt and the victim prey on my mind

perhaps a simple diversion:
a leap and i'm gone
deny it ever happened:
it's the drugs she's on

and i can't see my clothes anyway
they're probably lining the stairs
and down through the hallway

and as i turn to confront her
to tell her the truth
those eyes...
that mouth...
those shoulders...

i'm in bed with your best friend
