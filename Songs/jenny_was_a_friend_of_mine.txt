we took a walk that night but it wasn't the same
we had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
she said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
she couldn't scream while i held her close
i swore i'd never let her go

tell me what you wanna know
oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
there ain't no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
so come on, oh come on, oh come on

i know my rights, i've been here all day and it's time
for me to go so let me know if it's all right
i just can't take this, i swear i told you the truth
she couldn't scream while i held her close
i swore i never let her go

tell me what you wanna know
oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
and then you whisper in my ear
"i know what you're doing here"
so come on, oh come on, oh come on

there ain't no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
oh
