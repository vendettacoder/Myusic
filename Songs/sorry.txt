no, i mean it, i'm really sorry; here i'll say it again
i want you to know it, but the more i say it
the less it means in the end
working for respect's like climbing a mountain
and i think i'm losing my grip
once i'm fallin' and i think i'm fallin'
there's no gettin' back on pace
but my face makes that sorry shape
i know who i am, but i lost my grace
i'm gettin' a stick and i march for more
now i was wrong, everybody knows
my mouth is moving but nothing's changing
i just can't leave it alone
nervous defense that's doubled to senseless
milked it dry like a bone
i milked it dry like a bone
i just can't leave it alone
i milked it dry like a bone
i just can't leave it alone
but my face makes that sorry shape
i know who i am, but i lost my grace
i'm gettin' a stick and i march for more
now i was wrong, everybody knows
everybody knows
no, i mean it, i'm really sorry; here i'll say it again
i want you to know it that the more i say it
