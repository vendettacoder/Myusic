"bah, humbug!" no, that's too strong 
'cause it is my favorite holiday 
but all this year's been a busy blur 
don't think i have the energy

to add to my already mad rush 
just 'cause it's 'tis the season. 
the perfect gift for me would be 
completions and connections left from

last year, ski shop, 
encounter, most interesting. 
had his number but never the time 
most of '81 passed along those lines.

so deck those halls, trim those trees 
raise up cups of christmas cheer, 
i just need to catch my breath, 
christmas by myself this year.

calendar picture, frozen landscape, 
chilled this room for twenty-four days, 
evergreens, sparkling snow 
get this winter over with!

flashback to springtime, saw him again, 
would've been good to go for lunch, 
couldn't agree when we were both free, 
we tried, we said we'd keep in touch.

didn't, of course, 'til summertime, 
out to the beach to his boat could i join him? 
no, this time it was me, 
sunburn in the third degree.

now the calendar's just one page 
and, of course, i am excited 
tonight's the night, but i've set my mind 
not to do too much about it.

merry christmas! merry christmas! 
but i think i'll miss this one this year. 
merry christmas! merry christmas! 
but i think i'll miss this one this year.
merry christmas! merry christmas! 
but i think i'll miss this one this year. 
merry christmas! merry christmas! 
but i think i'll miss this one this year.


hardly dashing through the snow
cause i bundled up too tight
last minute have-to-do's
a few cards a few calls
'cause it's r-s-v-p
no thanks, no party lights
it's christmas eve, gonna relax
turned down all of my invites.

last fall i had a night to myself, 
same guy called, halloween party, 
waited all night for him to show, 
this time his car wouldn't go,

forget it, it's cold, it's getting late, 
trudge on home to celebrate 
in a quiet way, unwind 
doing christmas right this time.

a&amp;p has provided me 
with the world's smallest turkey 
already in the oven, nice and hot 
oh damn! guess what i forgot?

so on with the boots, back out in the snow 
to the only all-night grocery, 
when what to my wondering eyes should appear 
in the line is that guy i've been chasing all year!

"i'm spending this one alone," he said. 
"need a break; this year's been crazy." 
i said, "me too, but why are you? 
you mean you forgot cranberries too?"

then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
caught on to what was happening 
that christmas magic's brought this tale 
to a very happy ending! "

merry christmas! merry christmas! 
couldn't miss this one this year! 
merry christmas! merry christmas! 
couldn't miss this one this year!
