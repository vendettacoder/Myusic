can you feel it,can you feel it,can you feel it!

if you look around
the whole world's coming together now.
can you feel it,can you feel it,can you feel it!
feel it in the air
the wind is taking it everywhere.
can you feel it,can you feel it,can you feel it!


all the colors of the world should be
lovin' each other wholeheartedly.
yes it's alright,take my message to your brother and tell him twice.
spread the word who tried to teach the man who is hatin' his brother,
when hate won't do
'cause we're all the same 
yes the blood inside of me is inside of you.

now tell me!

can you feel it,can you feel it,can you feel it!
can you see what's going down, you can feel it in your bones

every breath you take,
is someone's death in another place.
every healthy smile,
is hunger and strife to another child.
but the stars do shine
and promising salvation is near this time.
can you feel it now,
so brothers and sisters
shall we know how.

now tell me!
can you feel it,tell me can you feel it,can you feel it!
talk now can you see what's going down open up your mind. 

all the children of the world should be 
lovin' each other wholeheartedly
yes it's alright
take my message to your brother and tell him twice.
take the news to the marchin' men
who are killin' their brothers,when death won't do.
yes we're all the same
yes the blood inside my veins is inside of you.

now tell me!
can you feel it,can you feel it,can you feel it!
can you feel it,can you feel it,can you feel it!
