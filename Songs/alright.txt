we are young
we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
feel alright

we wake up, we go out
smoke a fag, put it out
see our friends, see the sights
feel alright

are we like you
i can't be sure?
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we get by
can't go mad, ain't got time
sleep around if we like
but we're alright

got some cash
bought some wheels
took it out
'cross the fields
lost control, hit a wall
but we're alright

are we like you
i can't be sure?
of the scene, as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young
we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
feel alright

are we like you
i can't be sure?
of the scene, as she turns
we are strange in our world

but we are young
we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
feel alright
