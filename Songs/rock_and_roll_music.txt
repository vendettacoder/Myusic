just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a back beat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
gotta be rock-roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

i got no kick against modern jazz
unless they try to play it too darn fast
and lose the beauty of the melody
until it sounds just like a symphony

that's why i go for that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a back beat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
it's gotta be rock-roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

i took my love on over 'cross the tracks
and she declaim a man a wailin' sax
i must admit they had a rockin' band
man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'

that's why i go for that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
it's got a back beat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
gotta be rock and roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

way down south they had a jubilee
them georgia folks they had a jamboree
they're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
the folks were dancin' and got all shook up

and started playin' that rock and roll music
any old time you use it
it's got a back beat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
gotta be rock-roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me

don't care to hear them play a tango
i'm in no mood to take a mambo
it's way too early for a congo
so keep on rockin' that piano

that's why i go for that rock and roll music
any old time you use it
it's got a black beat, you can't lose it
any old time you use it
oughta got rock-roll music
if you wanna dance with me
if you wanna dance with me
