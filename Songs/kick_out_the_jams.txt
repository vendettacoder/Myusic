and right now, right now
right now, it's time to
kick out the jams motherfuckers

yeah, i, i, i, i, i'm gonna
i'm gonna kick 'em out, yeah

well i feel pretty good and i guess that i could get crazy now, baby
'cause we all got in tune and when the dressing room got hazy, now baby
i know how you want it child, hot, quick and tight
the girls can't stand it when you're doin' it right

let me up on the stand and let me kick out the jam
yes, kick out the jams
i want to kick 'em out

yes, i'm starting to sweat, you know my shirt's all wet, what a feeling
in the sound that abounds and resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
you gotta have it baby, you can't do without
when you get that feeling, you gotta sock 'em out

put that mike in my hand and let me kick out the jam
yes, kick out the jams
i want to kick 'em out

so you got to give it up, you know you can't get enough miss mackenzie
'cause it gets in your brain, it drives you insane with the frenzy
the wigglin' guitars girl, the crash of the drums
make you wanna keep a rockin' till morning comes

let me be who i am and let me kick out the jam
yes, kick out the jams
i done kicked 'em out
