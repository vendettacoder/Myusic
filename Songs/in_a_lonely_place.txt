caressing the marble and stone
love that was special for one
the waste in the fever i heat
how i wish you were here with me now

body that curls in and dies
and shares that awful daylight
warm like a dog round your feet
how i wish you were here with me now

hangman looks round as he waits
cord stretches tight then it breaks
someday we will die in your dreams
how i wish you were here with me now
