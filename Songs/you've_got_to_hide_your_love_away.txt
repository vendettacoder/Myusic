here i stand head in hand
turn my face to the wall
if she's gone i can't go on
feeling two foot small

everywhere people stare
each and every day
i can see them laugh at me
and i hear them say

hey, you've got to hide your love away
hey, you've got to hide your love away

how can i even try?
i can never win
hearing them, seeing them
in the state i'm in

how could she say to me
love will find a way?
gather round, all you clowns
let me hear you say

hey, you've got to hide your love away
hey, you've got to hide your love away
