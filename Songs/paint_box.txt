last night i had too much to drink
sitting in a club with so many fools
playing to rules
trying to impress but feeling rather empty
i had another drink
drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink

what a way to spend that evening
they all turn up with their friends
playing the game
they're in the scene always should have been
far away
away - away - away - away - away
getting up, i feel as if i'm remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget

pretend the phone rings and someone speaks
she would very much like to go out to a show
so what can i do - i can't think of what to say
she sees through anyway
away - away - away - away - away

out of the front door i go
traffic's moving rather slow
arriving late, there she waits
looking very angry, as cross as she can be
be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be
getting up, i feel as if i'm remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget
