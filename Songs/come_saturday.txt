i can't stand to see your picture
on the dresser where i left it
another sunny day and you're 80 miles away
tuesday

but come saturday, you'll come to stay
you'll come to sway in my arms
who cares if there's a party somewhere?
we're gonna stay in

come saturday, you'll come to say
maybe there's no harm
in a wasted summer with no drummer
we're gonna stay in

i could stand to be a fixture
in your faded family picture
but i can't see into the sunset
all i know is that you're perfect right now

come saturday, you'll come to stay
you'll come to sway in my arms
who cares if there's a party somewhere?
we're gonna stay in

come saturday, you'll come to say
maybe there's no harm
in a wasted summer with no drummer
we're gonna stay in

you don't have to write at all, you don't have to make a call
i know that you will come again and again
you don't have to dress to please, perhaps undress for me
i know that when you come we'll be staying in
