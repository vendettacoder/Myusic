i got a broken face, i got a...
i got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh
i got a broken face
i got a broken face
i got a broken face

there was this boy who had two children
with his sisters
who were his daughters
who were his favorite lovers

i got no lips, i got no tongue
where there were eyes, there's only space
i got no lips, i got no tongue

i got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh
i got a broken face

there was this man who snapped his brain
in little pieces
and then they drilled holes
and then they put 'em back in there

i got no lips, i got no tongue
where there were eyes, there's only space
i got no lips, i got no tongue

i got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh
i got a broken face

the little thing who does my laundry
speaks no english
but if you saw her
you'd say, "isn't she lovely?"

i got no lips, i got no tongue
where there were eyes, there's only space
i got no lips, i got no tongue
