yes, this is the campaign
slithered entrails in the cargo bay
neutered is the vastness
hallow vacuum, check the oxygen tanks
they hibernate but have they kissed the ground?
pucker up and kiss the asphalt now
tease this amputation
splintered larynx, it has access now

banked on memory
mummified circuitry
skin graft machinery
sputnik sickles found in the seats
self-destruct sequence
this station is non-operational
species growing
bubbles in an iv loitering

unknown origins
is this the comfort of being afraid?
solar eclipsed
black out the vultures as they wait
unknown, unknown, to do oh ho
unknown, unknown, yeah

dissect a trillion sighs away
will you get this letter?
jagged pulp sliced in my veins
i write to remember
'cause i'm a million miles away
will you get this letter?
jagged pulp sliced in my veins
i write to remember
