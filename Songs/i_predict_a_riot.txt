oh, watchin' the people get lairy
it's not very pretty, i tell thee
walkin' through town is quite scary
and not very sensible either
a friend of a friend he got beaten
he looked the wrong way at a policeman
would never have happened to smeaton
an old leodiensian

i predict a riot, i predict a riot
i predict a riot, i predict a riot

oh, i try to get to my taxi
a man in a tracksuit attacks me
he said that he saw it before me
wants to get things a bit gory
girls scrabble round with no clothes on
to borrow a pound for a condom
if it wasn't for chip fat, they'd be frozen
they're not very sensible

i predict a riot, i predict a riot
i predict a riot, i predict a riot

and if there's anybody left in here
that doesn't want to be out there

ow!
