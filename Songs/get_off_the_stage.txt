oh, you silly old man 
you silly old man 
you're making a fool of yourself 
so get off the stage 

you silly old man 
in your misguided trousers 
with your mascara and your fender guitar 
and you think you can arouse us?

but the song that you just sang 
it sounds exactly like the last one 
and the next one 
i bet you it will sound 
like this one 

downstage, and offstage 
don't you feel all run in?
and do you wonder when they will take it away?
this is your final fling 

but then applause ran high 
but for the patience of the ones behind you 
as a verse drags on like a month drags on 
it's very short, but it seems very long 

and the song that you just sang 
it sounds exactly like the last one 
and the next one 
i bet you it will sound 
like this one 

so, get off the stage 
oh, get off the stage 
and when we get down off of the stage 
please stay off the stage - all day!

get off the stage 
oh, get off the stage 
and when we've had our money back 
then i'd like your back in plaster 

oh, i know that you say 
how age has no meaning 
oh, but here is your audience now 
and they're screaming: 

"get off the stage"
oh, get off the stage 
because i've given you enough of my time 
and the money that wasn't even mine 
have you seen yourself recently?

oh, get off the stage 
oh, get off the stage 
for whom, oh... 
for whom, oh... 
for whom, oh... 
for whom, oh... 

get off the stage 
get off the stage 
get off the stage 

for whom the bell tolls
