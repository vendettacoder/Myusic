holy girl, don't get up for running
stay with me, i feel sad when you run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run
sands of time are lying on my chest 
stay in bed, i feel sad when you run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

stay like this on the hills of my chest 
don't wake up, i feel strange when you go 
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
go, go, go, go
stop the night, hold me tight, holy girl
don't stand up, i feel strange when you go
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
