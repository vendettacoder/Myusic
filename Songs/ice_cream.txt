verse one: ghostface killer (tony starks)

yo honey-dips, summertime, fine jheri drippin
see you on pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin
i catch shootin strong notes as we got close
she rocked rope, honey throat smellin like impulse
your whole shell baby's wicked like nimrod
caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may i not be god
attitude is very rude boo, crabby like seafood
it turns me on like vassey and lahrule
they call me starky love-hun, check the strategy
by any means, shirley temple cross was done by billie jean's
black misses america, your name is erica, right true
lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe
caramel complexion, breath smellin like cinnamon
excuse me hon, the don mean no harm, turn around again
god damn, backyard's bangin like a benz-y
