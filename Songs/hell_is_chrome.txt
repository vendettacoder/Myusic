when the devil came 
he was not red 
he was chrome, and he said 

come with me 
you must go 
so i went 
where everything was clean 
so precise and towering 

i was welcomed 
with open arms 
i received so much help in every way 
i felt no fear 
i felt no fear 

the air was crisp 
like sunny late winter days 
a springtime yawning high in the haze 
and i felt like i belonged 
come with me 

come with me 
come with me 
come with me 
come with me 
come with me 
come with me 
come with me
