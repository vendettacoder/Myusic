i am a germ under your skin
i crawl through your veins and i work my way in
i play with your health i destroy all there is
i m the germ in your mouth when you give her a kiss

and tomorrow they'll put you away
and the doctors all they will say
is- you re gonna die

i am a germ under your skin
like a hypodermic needle pushed in
i run in your blood and i screw up your brain
i've got a disease just to send you insane

i am a germ under your skin
and i got a feeling i m gonna win
it s no use believing in the national health
cos when you are dead i'll destroy someone else
