kicking out the bad guy
beating up a monster
fighting against evil
i rescue the peace now

over the buildings
over the mountains
over the blue sky
over the rainbow

you know i'm a super girl
yes i'm a punky girl
i never say die 
no one can stop me

flying at the high speed
having over courage
getting over crisis
i rescue the people

over the buildings
over the mountains
over the blue sky
over the rainbow

you know i'm a super girl
yes i'm a punky girl
i never say die 
no one can stop me
'cause i like to fight crime!

kicking out the bad guy

flying at the high speed
having over courage 
getting over crisis
i rescue the people

you know i'm a super girl
yes i'm a punky girl
i never say die 
no one can stop me
'cause i like to fight fight!
