driving in the south, the motor's on fire
let's put it out, before the flames go higher

monday matinee, 'big bully' or 'white squall'
so hard to choose, wish we could see them all

some college in the spring, the sound is all wrong
we set the mains to our favorite hootie song

driving (not again), an 8 car crash
we'll turn to look unless we're going too fast
