i've been up to villiers terrace
to see what's a-happening
there's people rolling 'round on the carpet
mixing up the medicine

i've been up to villiers terrace
i saw what's a-happening
people rolling 'round on the carpet
biting wool and pulling string
you said people rolled on carpet
but i never thought they'd do those things

i've been up to villiers terrace
i've been in a daze for days
i drank some of the medici-i-i-ine 
and i didn't like the taste

i've been up to villiers terrace

biting wool and pulling string
you said people rolled on carpet
but i never thought they'd do those things

been up to villiers terrace
to see what's a-happening
people rolling 'round on the carpet
passing 'round the medicine

been up to villiers terrace
i saw what's a-happening
there's people rolling 'round on my carpet
biting wool and pulling string
you said people rolled on carpet, boys
but i never thought they'd do those things
