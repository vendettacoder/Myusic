when we were young nobody died
and nobody got older
the toughest kid in the street
could always be bought over
and the first time that you loved
you had all your life to give
at least that's what you said
the first time you got drunk
you drank pernod and dry cider
smashed a window in as the police came round the corner
you didn't have no time to run
and your dad stood up for you
as the judge said you're a fool

babies, sex and flagons, shifting women, getting stoned
robbing  cars, bars and pubs, rubber johnnies, poems
starsky and hutch gave good tv
and starsky looked like me

the first time that you stole
you stole rubber lips and tenners
bought a radio then ran away for ever
never felt so good, never felt so good with you
when we were young we had no fear
of love nor sex nor warnings
everyone was hanging out, everyone was sorted
when we were young nobody knew
who you were or what you'd do
nobody had a past that catches up on you

babies, sex and flagons, shifting women, getting stoned
robbing  cars, bars and pubs, rubber johnnies, poems
starsky and hutch gave good tv
and starsky looked like me

what might have been
what might have been
what might have been

with a start he was awoken
from the middle of a dream
he's making movies in his head
that never will be seen
he's holding oscars in his hands
and kissing beauty queens
what might have been
what might have been
when we were young
