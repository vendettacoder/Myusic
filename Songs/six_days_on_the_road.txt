i pulled out of pittsburgh an i rolling down the eastern seaboard
i've got my diesel wound up and she's running like she never did before
there's a speed zone ahead all right, i don't see a cop in sight
six days upon the road and i gotta see my baby tonight
i got ten forward gears and a sweet georgia overdrive
i'm taking little white pills and my eyes are open wide
just passed a jimmy and a white, i've been passing everything in sight
six days upon the road and i gotta see my baby tonight
it seems like a month since i kissed my baby bye bye
i got a lot of woman but i'm not like some of the guys
got my air horns running clear
baby you oughta watch the way i shift my gears
six days upon the road and i gotta see my baby tonight
icc is checking on down the line
honey you know i'm a little overweight and my log books way behind
but nothing bothers a soul at night, i can dodge them scales all right
six days upon the road and i gotta see my baby tonight
my rigs a little old but it don't mean she's slow
there's a good flame coming from her smokestack and the smoke's black as coal
my home town coming in sight, if you think i'm happy baby baby baby your right
six days upon the road and i gotta see my baby tonight
