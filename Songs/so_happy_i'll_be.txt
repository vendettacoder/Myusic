i'm just waitin' for the time to come when all sorrows will be done
then i'll be goin' home to heaven above
then i'll shout and sing with the angels up there tell the saviour of his love and care
that he had for me in this world below
so happy i'll be when my saviour i shall see
and tell him of his love that he had for me
no more sorrow grief or pain all the time will be the same
so happy i'll be forever more
[ ac.guitar ]
some happy time just wait and see my blessed saviour will come for me
then i'm goin' home to heaven above
where my loved ones have gone before so that bright and shining shore
so happy i'll be forever more
so happy i'll be...
[ ac.guitar ]
oh just think of the day my friends when the saints go marching in
then i'm goin' home to heaven above
oh so happy i'll be my blessed saviour i shall see so happy i'll be forever more
so happy i'll be...
