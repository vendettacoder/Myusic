when i heard the knock on the door i couldn't catch my breath
is it too late to call this off?

we could slip away, wouldn't that be better
me with nothing to say and you in your autumn sweater

i tried my best to hide in a crowded room, it's nearly possible
i wait for you, oh, most patiently

we could slip away, wouldn't that be better
me with nothing to say and you in your autumn sweater

so i looked for your eyes and the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
i'll try hard, i'll try always but it's a waste of time
it's a waste of time if i can't smile easily
like in the beginning, in the beginning

we could slip away, wouldn't that be better
me with nothing to say and you in your autumn sweater
we could slip away, wouldn't that be better
me with nothing to say and you in your autumn sweater
