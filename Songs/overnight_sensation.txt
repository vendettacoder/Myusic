well i know it sounds funny
but i'm not in it for the money, no
i don't need no reputation
and i'm not in it for the show

i just want a hit record, yeah
wanna hear it on the radio
want a big hit record, yeah
one that everybody's got to know

well if the program director don't pull it
it's time to get back the bullet
so bring the group down to the station
you're gonna be an overnight sensation

i've been tryin' to write the lyric
non-offensive but satiric too
and if you put it in the a-slot
it's just got to make a mint for you

i fit those words to a good melody
amazing how success has been ignoring me
so long
i use my bread making demos all day
writing in the night while in my head i hear
the record play
hear it play

hit record, yeah
wanna hit record, yeah
wanna hit record, yeah (number one)
