seems like the other day 
my baby went away 
he went away 'cross the sea 
it's been two years or so
since i saw my baby go 
and then this letter came for me 
it said that we were through 
he found somebody new 
oh, let me think, let me think, what can i do? 
oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no 

(remember) walkin' in the sand 
(remember) walkin' hand in hand 
(remember) the night was so exciting 
(remember) smile was so inviting 
(remember) then he touched my cheek 

(remember) with his fingertips 
softly, softly we'd meet with our lips 

whatever happened to 
the boy that i once knew? 
the boy who said he'd be true 
oh, what will happen to 
the life i gave to you? 
what will i do with it now? 

(remember) walkin' in the sand 
(remember) walkin' hand in hand 
(remember) the night was so exciting 
(remember) smile was so inviting 
(remember) then he touched my cheek 
(remember) with his fingertips 
softly, softly we'd meet with our lips
