in yellow shoes i get the blues
though i walk the streets with my plastic feet
with blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
there's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
in my paisley shirt i look a jerk
and my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
but oh oh my haircut looks so bad
vegetable man where are you? 

so i've changed my dear, and i find my knees
and i covered them up with the latest cut
and my pants and socks are bought in a box
it don't take long to buy nylon socks

the watch, black watch
my watch with a black face
and the date in a little hole
and all the lot is what i got
it's what i wear, it's what you see
it must be me, it's what i am
vegetable man where are you?

i've been looking all over the place for a place for me
but it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
vegetable man (vegetable man)
vegetable man (vegetable man)
vegetable man (vegetable man)
vegetable man
he's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can
vegetable man
