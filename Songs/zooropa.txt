zooropa... vorsprung durch technik 
zooropa... be all that you can be 
be a winner 
eat to get slimmer 

zooropa... a bluer kind of white 
zooropa... it could be yours tonight 
we're mild and green 
and squeaky clean 

zooropa... better by design 
zooropa... fly the friendly skies 
through appliance of science 
we've got that ring of confidence... 

and i have no compass 
and i have no map 
and i have no reasons 
no reasons to get back 

and i have no religion 
and i don't know what's what 
and i don't know the limit 
the limit of what we've got 

zooropa... don't worry baby, it'll be alright 
zooropa... you got the right shoes 
zooropa... to get you through the night 
zooropa... it's cold outside, but brightly lit 
zooropa... skip the subway 
zooropa... let's go to the overground 
get your head out of the mud baby 
put flowers in the mud baby 
overground 

no particular place names 
no particular song 
i've been hiding 
what am i hiding from? 

zooropa... don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright 
zooropa... uncertainty... can be a guiding light 
zooropa... i hear voices, ridiculous voices 
zooropa... in the slipstream 
zooropa... let's go, let's go... overground 
zooropa... take your head out of the mud baby 

she's gonna dream up 
the world she wants to live in 
she's gonna dream out loud
