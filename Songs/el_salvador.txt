there's a sunny little country south of mexico
where the winds are gentle and the waters flow
but breezes aren't the only things that blow 
in el salvador 

if you took the little lady for a moonlight drive
odds are still good you'd come back alive
but everyone is innocent until they arrive 
in el salvador 

if the rebels take a bus on the grand highway
the government destroys a village miles away
the man on the radio says 'now we'll play south of the border'
and in the morning the natives say,
we're happy you have lived another day
last night a thousand more passed away 
in el salvador

there's a television crew here from abc
filming rio lempe and the refugees
calling murdered children the 'tragedy' 
of el salvador 

before the government cameras 20 feet away
another man is asking for continued aid
food and medicine and hand grenades 
for el salvador 

there's a thump, a rumble, and the buildings sway
a soldier fires the acid spray
the public address system starts to play south of the border
you run for cover and hide your eyes
you hear the screams from paradise
they've fallen further than you realize
in el salvador 

just like poland is 'protected' by her russian friends
the junta is 'assisted' by americans
and if 60 million dollars seems too much to spend
in el salvador 

they say for half a billion they could do it right
bomb all day, burn all night
until there's not a living thing upright 
in el salvador 

they'll continue training troops in the usa
and watch the nuns that got away
and teach the military bands to play south of the border
and kill the people to set them free
who put this price on their liberty?
don't you think it's time to leave 
el salvador?
