i don't need to be a global citizen
'cause i'm blessed by nationality
i'm a member of a growing populace
we enforce our popularity

there are things that seem to pull us under and
there are things that drag us down
but there's a power and a vital presence
it's lurking all around

we've got the american jesus
see him on the interstate
we've got the american jesus
he helped build the president's estate

i feel sorry for the earth's population
'cause so few live in the usa
at least the foreigners can copy our morality
they can visit but they cannot stay

only precious few can garner our prosperity
it makes us walk with renewed confidence
we got a place to go when we die
and the architect resides right here

we've got the american jesus
bolstering national faith
we've got the american jesus
overwhelming millions every day

he's the farmer's barren fields, the force the army wields
(in god we trust)
expressions on the faces of the starving millions
(because he's one of us)
the power of the man, the fuel that drives the klan
(break down, cave in)
he's the motive and the conscience of the murderer
(he can redeem your sin)

he's the preacher on tv, the false sincerity
(strong heart, clear mind)
the form letter that's written by the big computers
(and infinitely kind)
the nuclear bombs, the kids with no moms
(you lose, we win)
and i'm fearful that he's inside me
(he is our champion)

we've got the american jesus
see him on the interstate
we've got the american jesus
exercising his authority

we've got the american jesus
bolstering national faith
we've got the american jesus
overwhelming millions every day

one nation, under god
one nation, under god
one nation, under god
one nation, under god
