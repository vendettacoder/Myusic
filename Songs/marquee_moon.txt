i remember how the darkness doubled
i recall lightnin' struck itself
i was listenin', listenin' to the rain
i was hearing, hearing something else

life in the hive puckered up my night
the kiss of death, the embrace of life
there i stand 'neath the marquee moon
just waiting

i spoke to a man down at the tracks
and i asked him how he don't go mad
he said "look here junior, don't you be so happy.
and for heaven's sake, don't you be so sad."

life in the hive puckered up my night
the kiss of death, the embrace of life
there i stand 'neath the marquee moon
hesitating

well a cadillac, it pulled out of the graveyard
pulled up to me, all they said "get in" ("get in")
then the cadillac, it puttered back into the graveyard
me, i got out again

life in the hive puckered up my night
the kiss of death, the embrace of life
there i stand 'neath the marquee moon
i ain't waiting, uh-uh

i remember how the darkness doubled
i recall lightning struck itself
i was listening, listening to the rain
i was hearing, hearing something else
