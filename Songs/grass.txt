laying on the grass, my heart, it flares like fire 
the way you slap my face just fills me with desire 
you play hard to get
'cause you're teacher's pet 
but when the boats have gone 
we'll take a tumble, excuse for a fumble

shocked me, too, the things we used to do on grass 
if you fancy, we can buy an ice cream cone 
your mate has gone, she didn't want to be alone 
i will pounce on you 
just us and the cuckoos 
you are helpless now 
over and over, we flatten the clover

shocked me, too, the things we used to do on grass 
it would shock you, too, the things we used to do on grass 
grass
on grass
things we did on grass
