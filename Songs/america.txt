"let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together"
"i've got some real estate here in my bag"
so we bought a pack of cigarettes and mrs. wagner pies
and walked off to look for america

"kathy," i said, as we boarded a greyhound in pittsburgh
"michigan seems like a dream to me now
it took me four days to hitchhike from saginaw
i've come to look for america"

laughing on the bus
playing games with the faces
she said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
i said, "be careful, his bowtie is really a camera"

"toss me a cigarette, i think there's one in my raincoat"
"we smoked the last one an hour ago"
so i looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
and the moon rose over an open field

"kathy, i'm lost," i said, though i knew she was sleeping
"i'm empty and aching, and i don't know why"
counting the cars on the new jersey turnpike
they've all come to look for america
all come to look for america
all come to look for america
