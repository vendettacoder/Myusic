i want to fly like an eagle
to the sea
fly like an eagle
let my spirit carry me
i want to fly like an eagle
'till i'm free
oh, lord, through the revolution

feed the babies
who don't have enough to eat
shoe the children
with no shoes on their feet
house the people
livin' in the street
oh, oh, there's a solution

i want to fly like an eagle
to the sea
fly like an eagle
let my spirit carry me
i want to fly like an eagle
'till i'm free
right through the revolution

time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'

time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'

time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'

to the sea
fly like an eagle
let my spirit carry me
i want to fly like an eagle
