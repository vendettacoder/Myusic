what a drag it is getting old

"kids are different today," i hear every mother say
mother needs something today to calm her down
and though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill
she goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
and it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

"things are different today," i hear every mother say
cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag
so she buys an instant cake, and she burns a frozen steak
and goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
and two help her on her way, get her through her busy day

doctor, please, some more of these
outside the door, she took four more
what a drag it is getting old

"men just aren't the same today," i hear every mother say
they just don't appreciate that you get tired
they're so hard to satisfy, you can tranquilize your mind
so go running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
and four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

doctor, please, some more of these
outside the door, she took four more
what a drag it is getting old

"life's just much too hard today," i hear every mother say
the pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
and if you take more of those, you will get an overdose
no more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
they just helped you on your way, through your busy dying day

hey
