every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i haven't missed you yet

every roommate kept awake
by every sigh and scream we make
all the feelings that i get
but i still don't miss you yet

only when i stop to think about it

i hate everything about you
why do i love you?
i hate everything about you
why do i love you?

every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i haven't missed you yet

only when i stop to think about it

i hate everything about you
why do i love you?
i hate everything about you
why do i love you?

only when i stop to think about you i know
only when you stop to think about me, do you know?

i hate everything about you
why do i love you?
you hate everything about me
why do you love me?

i hate, you hate
i hate, you love me!

i hate everything about you
why do i love you?
