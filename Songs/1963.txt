it was january, 1963
when johnny came home with a gift for me
he said 'i bought it for you because i love you
and i bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too'
he was so very nice, he was so very kind
to think of me at this point in time
i used to think of him, he used think of me

he told me to close my eyes
my gift would be a great surprise
i saw tears were in his eyes
he never meant to hurt me
oh, god, johnny, don't point that gun at me
there's so many ways our lives have changed
but please, i beg, don't do this to me
johnny, don't point that gun at me
can i save my life at any price?
for god's sake won't you listen to me?

and though he was ashamed that he had took a life
johnny came home with another wife
and he often remembered how it used to be
before that special occasion, 1963
there is too many ways that you could kill someone
like in a love affair, when the love has gone
he used to think of her, she used to think of him

he told me to close my eyes
my gift would be a great surprise
i saw tears were in his eyes
he never meant to hurt me
oh, god, johnny, don't point that gun at me
there's so many ways our lives have changed
but please, i beg, don't do this to me
johnny, you keep on using me
can i change my life for any price?
oh, johnny, won't you listen to me?

he told me to close my eyes
my gift would be a great surprise
i saw hatred in his eyes
but he never meant to hurt me
oh, god, johnny, don't point that gun at me
there's so many ways our lives have changed
but please, i beg, don't do this to me
johnny, you keep on using me
can i change my life for any price?
oh, johnny, won't you listen to me?

i just want you to be mine,
and i don't want this world to shine
i don't want this bridge to burn
oh, johnny, do you miss me?
i just want to feel free
i will always feel free
i will always feel free
i will always feel free
i will always feel free
