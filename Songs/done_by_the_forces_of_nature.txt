born buck-naked out my mother's womb
a man cooped up in a rubber room
time's changin' time flies
caterpillars turn into butterflies
a kitten grows up to be a tiger
i grows up to be a writer
children grow through puberty
and then they reach maturity
metamorphasizms
the force of nature has gotten in them
in my book that comes first
controls the soul and the universe
it's the nature...
blackman, blackheart, blacksoul
i was born to roll
roll, like water in an open stream
smooth as i can be
tick tock goes the hands of time
time puts meanin' to my rhymes
rhyme lets you know what's goin' on
what's goin' right and what's goin' wrong
power, poor, rich, and weak
there is some science to what i speak
and if there wasn't, i could not face ya
'cause this was brung...
by the forces of nature

take 5:
the pharoah blows...
tickle-tickle, trickle-trickle
you can't buy nature with a nickle
"excuse me for a minute" (the pharoah wipes his mouth)
"can i get some of that saxophone"
- mother nature plays, the pharoah likes -

rainbows, volcanoes, waterfalls, native calls
avalanches, tree with branches,
b. boys in their favorites stances
ejaculation, menstruation
a prayer to god is a confrontation
dirt and soil, gas and oil
gold, copper, silver, tin foil
love ya momma mother nature
but some act through as if they hate ya
artificials, man-mades
they don't use lemon to make lemonades
everything i see is 1/2 real
zipped-locked, rapped up, signed and sealed
gettin' ready to return back to the source
about to get done by the force...of nature

recess

boy, girl, sister, brother
wife, husband, friend, lover
you can't change what's meant to be
you can't hit what you can't see
it's easier for a camel to walk through
the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven
treble, bass, haste makes waste
nature puts things in the right place
hot, baked, carrot cake
in life there's many things at stake
roads, places, avenues, streets
i'll walk a mile for a funk-e beat
i put these words in a special order
because i was overcome by the forces of nature
