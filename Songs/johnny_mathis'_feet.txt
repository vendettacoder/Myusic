i lay all my songs at johnny mathis' feet 
i said, "johnny tell me 
can you tell me how to live? 
all my hopes are unraveling and i just lost my lease 
on my house without love, doors, or windows 
without peace." 

and with a wave of his jewel-encrusted hand 
across the glittering las vegas scene he said, 
"you gotta learn how to disappear in the silk and amphetamine." 

johnny looked at my songs and he said, 
"well at first guess, never in my life 
have i ever seen such a mess. 
why do you say everything as if you were a thief? 
like what you've stolen has no value 
like what you preach is far from belief?" 

and with a wave of his red white and blue hand 
across the glittering hollywood scene he said, 
"you gotta learn how to disappear in the silk and amphetamine." 

johnny looked at my old collection of punk rock posters 
anonymous scenes of disaffection choas and torture 
and he said, "you were on the right track 
but you're a lamb jumping for the knife." 
he said, "a real showman knows how  
to disappear in the spotlight."
