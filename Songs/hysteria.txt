so lonely for the taste of all the tears 
you told me meant so much through out the years 
if only you could tell your stranger friend
everything you've heard and seen 
selling all her secrets on a television screen 

i know you know that it's too late 
i know you know you love to hate 

hysteria draped in red and white and blue 
mass media and you think you know its true 
i've seen ya with your bouquets and your flowers 
screaming crying hoping lying 
and when the chips are down you're gonna start denying

sometime you're gonna stare us in the eye 
and maybe see what's going on inside 
lately you've got nothing left to hide 
screaming crying hoping lying 
and when the chips are down your going to start denying
