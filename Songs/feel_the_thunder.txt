slicing throught the night 
three riders came
perched on american steel 
riders with no name
even time cannot reveal 
riders with no name

on october 31st many years ago 
three friends went out for a ride 
for it was a famous party night 
and to party was to get high
they loaded up on beer and cocaine
then they started their bikes with a roar
they couldn't have known that on that night
they were beginning their longest tour

feel the thunder 
of the midnight ride
earth torn asunder 
by those who died

onto their favorite road they rode
leather horsemen riding three wide
their metal beasts howled in the night
a dark spectre was their guide
they came around a curve too fast
only time for a scream
a fiery crash of chrome and steel
was the beginning of their longest dream

feel the thunder 
of the midnight ride
earth torn asunder 
by those who died

feel the thunder 
of the midnight ride
earth torn asunder 
by those who died

and the fates decreed on that night 
their souls must be tried 
now you can hear them every all hallows eve 
forever doomed to ride

slicing throught the night 
three riders came
perched on american steel 
riders with no name
even time cannot reveal 
riders with no name

feel the thunder 
of the midnight ride
earth torn asunder 
by those who died
