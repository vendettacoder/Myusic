london never sleeps, it just sucks
the life out of me
and the money from my pocket

london always creeps, showbiz hugs
the life out of me
have some dignity honey

euston, paddington, train station please
make the red lights turn green
endlessly
my black cab rolls through the neon disease
endlessly, endlessly

london never sleeps, it just sucks
the life out of me

sushi bars, wet fish, it just sucks
the life out of me
and the money from my pocket

euston, paddington, train station please
make the red lights turn green
endlessly
my black cab rolls through the neon disease
endlessly, endlessly

i come alive outside the m25
i won't drink the poison thames
i'll chase the sun out west
