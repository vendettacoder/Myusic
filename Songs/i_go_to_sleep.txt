when i look up from my pillow
i dream you are there with me
though you are far away
i know you'll always be near to me

i go to sleep, sleep
and imagine that you're there with me
i go to sleep, sleep
and imagine that you're there with me

i look around me
and feel you are ever so close, to me
each tear that flows from my eye
brings back memories of you to me

i go to sleep, sleep
and imagine that you're there with me
i go to sleep, sleep
and imagine that you're there with me

i was wrong, i would cry
i will love you till the day i die
you were all, you and no one else
you were meant for me

when morning comes again
i have been lonely since you left me
each day drags by
until finally night time descends on me

i go to sleep, sleep
and imagine that you're there with me
i go to sleep, sleep
and imagine that you're there with me
