thrown like a star in my vast sleep
i opened my eyes to take a peek
to find that i was by the sea
gazing with tranquility

'twas then when the hurdy gurdy man
came singing songs of love
then when the hurdy gurdy man
came singing songs of love

"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang
"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang
"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang

histories of ages past
unenlightened shadows cast
down through all eternity
the crying of humanity

'tis then when the hurdy gurdy man
comes singing songs of love
then when the hurdy gurdy man
comes singing songs of love

"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang
"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurd
hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang

"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang
here comes the roly poly man
he's singing songs of love
"roly poly, roly poly, holy poly poly" he sang
"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang
"hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang
