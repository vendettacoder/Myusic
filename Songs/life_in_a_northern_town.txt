the salvation army band played
and the children drunk lemonade
and the morning lasted all day, all day
and through an open window came
like sinatra in a younger day
pushing the town away, oh

ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
life in a northern town
ah hey ma ma ma ma

they sat on the stoney ground
and he took a cigarette out
and everyone else came down to listen
he said in winter 1963
it felt like the world would freeze
with john f. kennedy
and the beatles

yeah, yeah
ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
life in a northern town
hey ma ma ma ma
ah hey ma ma ma
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
all the work shut down

the evening turned to rain
watched the water roll down the drain
as we followed him down to the station
and though he never would wave goodbye
you could see it written in his eyes
as the train rolled out of sight...bye-bye

ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
life in a northern town
ah hey ma ma ma ma
ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
life in a northern town

ah hey ma ma ma ma
ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
ah hey ma ma ma ma
take it easy on yourself
ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
