everybody is in too many pieces
no-man's-land surrounds our desires
to crack the shell we mix with others
some lie in the arms of lovers

the city is the place to be
with no money you go crazy
i need an occupation!
you have to pay for satisfaction

we live as we dream, alone
to crack the shell we mix with the others
some flirt with fascism
some lie in the arms of lovers

we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone

we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone

everybody is in too many pieces
no-man's-land surrounds me!
with no money we'll all go crazy
(we apologize)

man and woman need to work
it helps us define ourselves
we were not born in isolation
but sometimes it seems that way

we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone

we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone

we live as we dream, alone
the space between our work and its product
some fall into fatalism
as if it started this way

we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone

we live as we dream, alone
(we live as we dream, alone)
we live as we dream, alone
(we were not born in isolation)
we live as we dream, alone
(but sometimes it seems that way)

(the space between our work and its product)

we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone
(as if it always must be this way)
we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone
we live as we dream, alone
(with no money we'll all go crazy)
