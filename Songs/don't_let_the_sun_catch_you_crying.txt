(marsden - marsden - chadwick - maguire)

don't let the sun catch you cryin'
the night's the time for all your tears
your heart may be broken tonight
but tomorrow in the morning light
don't let the sun catch you cryin'

the night-time shadows disappear
and with them go all your tears
for the morning will bring joy
for every girl and boy
so don't let the sun catch you cryin'

we know that cryin's not a bad thing
but stop your cryin' when the birds sing

it may be hard to discover
that you've been left for another
but don't forget that love's a game
and it can always come again
oh don't let the sun catch you cryin'
don't let the sun catch you cryin', oh no
oh, oh, oh
