stop while you've still got
the time
look what you've done to
yourself
stop while you've still got
the time
look what you've done to
yourself
stop with the rape of the
earth
you were not made for this
stop with your campaign of hate
stop before it is too late
the bell tolls
the bell tolls
bringing the moment of truth
ringing its warning
it's ringing
the moment of truth
wake-up
wake-up
wake-up
wake-up
