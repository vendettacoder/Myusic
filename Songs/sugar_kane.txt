you're perfect in the way
a perfect end today
you're burning out their lights
and burning in their eyes
i love you, sugar kane
a-comin' from the rain
oh, kiss me like a frog
and turn me into flame
i love you all the time
i need you 8 to 9
and i can stay all night
your body shining

and i know
there's something down there, sugar soul
back to the cross a twisted lane
there's something down there, sugar kane

i'm back again in love
i'm back again a dove
where'd you get your light
your smilin' sugar life
another lovers day
another cracked up night
every night i say
the light is coming

and i know
there's something down there, sugar cone
back to the cross a twisted lane
there's something down there, sugar kane

hey angel, come and play
and fly me away
a stroll along the beach
until you're out of time
i love you, sugar kane
a crack into the dream
i love you, sugar kane
i love you, sugar kane
i love you, sugar kane
i love you, sugar kane
i love you, sugar kane
i love you, sugar
