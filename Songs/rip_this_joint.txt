mama says yes, papa says no
make up you mind 'cause i gotta go
i'm gonna raise hell at the union hall
drive myself right over the wall

'round and 'round and 'round we go
roll this joint, gonna get down low
start my starter, gonna stop the show
oh, yeah

mister president, mister immigration man

then slip it right across into buffalo
dick and pat in ole d.c.
well they're gonna hold some shit for me

oh, now, baby, won't you hear me sing
flip flop, fit to drop
come on, baby, won't you let it rock?

oh, yeah, oh, yeah

kiss me quick, baby, won'tcha make my day
down to new orleans with the dixie dean
'cross to dallas, texas with the butter queen

rip this joint, gonna rip yours, too
some brand new steps and some weight to lose
gonna roll this joint, gonna get down low
'round and 'round and 'round we'll go

wham, bam, birmingham, alabam' don't give a damn
little rock fit to drop
ah, let it rock
