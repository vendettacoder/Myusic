what's happening to me?
 is it happening to you?
 look over there
 sky meets the sea
 blue on blue

 you wanna be free
 what do you do?
 get yourself where
 sky meets the sea
 blue on blue
 
i hurt so much
 i didn't understand
 i needed
 sun and sea
 and you beside me
 on the sand
 
a tropical night
 what do you do?
 look at the stars
 ever so bright
 me and you
 
out on the sea
 a boat sailing through
 take us away
 just you and me
 blue on blue
