yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning
to the sound of your alarm clock alarm
about an hour from now
you should be at the place of employment
which is annoying cause it's so boring
your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them
it affects your occupational performance
you wonder why your work load is so enormous
because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office
people get depressed, they get ulcers
from the stress that the corporate environment causes
regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this
seems to me like you've got one of four choices:
you could take a new job offer for more chips
stick it out a little longer or forfeit
but my advice to anybody that wants to quit
it'll feel much better if you say it like this:

(biz markie)
take this job and shove it
i ain't workin here no more
take this job and shove it
i ain't workin here no more
take this job and shove it
i ain't workin here no more
take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it

yo, if your boss is a s-o-b
tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b
put your middle finger up slowly
put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely
say i ain't workin here no more
who do you think you are?
rip your apron off, throw it on the floor
run to the door, to the payphone
make a toll-free call
tell your spouse what happened and where you are
so they can come and get you in the car later on
and help you search for a new 9 to 5 job
if the unemployment line ain't that long
you can take your time printin out w-9 forms
eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough
and you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough
maybe you hate it, maybe you love it
but if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to

(biz markie)
take this job and shove it
i ain't workin here no more
take this job and shove it
i ain't workin here no more
take this job and shove it
i ain't workin here no more
take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it

yo, some occupations are like slave gigs
the boss is favored and get placed in something spacious
while the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces
or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated
you constantly waitin for a paycheck
twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet
here's a optimistic motto
if you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow
most 9 to 5
