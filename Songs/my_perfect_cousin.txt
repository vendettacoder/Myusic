now, i've got a cousin called kevin
he's sure to go to heaven
always spotless, clean and neat
as smooth as you'll get 'em

he's got a fur lined sheepskin jacket
my ma said they cost a packet
but she won't even let me explain
that me and kevin we're just not the same

oh, my perfect cousin
what i like to do he doesn't
he's his family's pride and joy
his mother's little golden boy

he's got a degree in economics
maths, physics and bionics
he thinks that i'm a cabbage
'cause i hate university challenge

even at the age of ten
smart boy kevin was a smart boy then
he always beat me at subbuteo
'cause he "flicked to kick"
and i didn't know

oh, my perfect cousin
what i like to do he doesn't
he's his family's pride and joy
his mother's little golden boy

his mother bought him a synthesiser
got the human league into advise her
now he's making lots of noise
playing along with the art school boys

girls try to attract his attention
but what a shame, it's in vain, total rejection
he will never be left on the shelf
'cause kevin, he's in love with himself

oh, my perfect cousin
what i like to do he doesn't
he's his family's pride and joy
his mother's little golden boy
