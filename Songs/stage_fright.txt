now deep in the heart of a lonely kid
who suffered so much for what he did
they gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
since that day he ain't been the same

see the man with the stage fright
just standin' up there to give it all his might
and he got caught in the spotlight
but when we get to the end
he wants to start all over again

i've got fire water right on my breath
and the doctor warned me i might catch a death
said, "you can make it in your disguise
just never show the fear that's in your eyes"

see the man with the stage fright
just standin' up there to give it all his might
he got caught in the spotlight
but when we get to the end
he wants to start all over again

now if he says that he's afraid
take him at his word
and for the price that the poor boy has paid
he gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh

your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry
fancy people go driftin' by
the moment of truth is right at hand
just one more nightmare you can stand

see the man with the stage fright
just standin' up there to give it all his might
and he got caught in the spotlight
but when we get to the end
he wants to start all over again, hmm hmm
you wanna try it once again, hmm hmm
please don't make him stop, hmm hmm
let him take it from the top, hmm hmm
let him start all over again
