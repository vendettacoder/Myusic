i got in a tussle
with a stranger on the train
his face was familiar
but i couldn't place the name
it got to be ugly
??
i hope that no-one who could see
would be someone who'd know you

i had a small run-in
with a driver and his wife
you might call it road rage
??
considered nothing
i held my ground
and now that it's over
i've said that there must be
a better way

i keep it in mind
eight times out of nine
i'm wrong or i'm right
it's not worth a fight
but what's hard to define
makes it tough to decide
you don't realize
until after it has begun
whether this is the one
i probably knew better
i probably knew better

consider nothing
i held my ground

i'll say that there must be
a better way

i keep it in mind
eight times out of nine
i'm wrong or i'm right
it's not worth a fight
but what's hard to abide
it's tough to decide
we don't realize
until after it has begun
whether this was the one
i probably knew better
