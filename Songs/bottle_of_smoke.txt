thanks and praises, thanks to jesus
i bet on the bottle of smoke
i went to hell and to the races
to bet on the bottle of smoke

the day being clear, the sky being bright
he came up on the left like a streak of light
like a drunken fuck on a saturday night
up came the bottle of smoke

twenty-fucking-five to one
me gambling days are done
i bet on a horse called the bottle of smoke
and my horse won

stewards inquiries, swift and fiery
i had the bottle of smoke
inquisitions and suppositions
i had the bottle of smoke

fuck the stewards, a trip to lourdes
might give the old fuckers the power of sight
screaming springers and stoppers and call out coppers
but the money still gleams in my hand like a light

twenty-fucking-five to one
me gambling days are done
i bet on a horse called the bottle of smoke
and my horse won

bookies cursing, cars reversing
i had the bottle of smoke
glasses steaming, vessels bursting
i had the bottle of smoke

slip a fifty to the wife
and for each brat, a brand new five
to give me a break on a saturday night
when i had the bottle of smoke

twenty-fucking-five to one
me gambling days are done
i bet on a horse called the bottle of smoke
and my horse won

priests and maidens, drunk as pagans
they had the bottle of smoke
sins forgiven and celebrations
they had the bottle of smoke

fuck the yanks and drink their wines
the moon is clear, the sky is bright
i'm happy as the horse's shite
up came the bottle of smoke

twenty-fucking-five to one
me gambling days are done
i bet on a horse called the bottle of smoke
and my horse won
