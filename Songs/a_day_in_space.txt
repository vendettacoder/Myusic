elvis sang that 
and ever since i've been young 
i've had a dream about going into space 
lying there in the darkness and staring down 
watching continents drift by and come round again 
drift by and come round again 

i always want to launch myself from space and dive down 
through the atmosphere through the clouds and the air 
and swoop over the heads of people walking and shopping and talking 
in moscow or paris or rome 
or wherever

i'd be moving so fast i'd just have time to see their astonished faces 
before i was off again 
back off to my space base 
which could be anything really 
an asteroid a moon or a spaceship 
it's never been that clearly defined in my dreams 

but its not important 
just to be in space would be the important thing 
just to be in space would be the important thing 

and i've spoken to lots of people about my desire to go to space 
and they think it's stupid 
they say things like 
what about the training? 
i hear its very hard 
i say hard? hard my arse!
a couple of assault courses and a maths test 
a piece of piss 
i've suffered worse than that 
i've suffered much worse than that 

sometimes i wonder what's wrong with people 
i think they've gone simultaneously soft or stupid 
or they're living in fear 
but i dunno why 
there's nothing to fear about space 
space is brilliant 
space is brilliant 

and i've told people 
i'd pay a million pounds to go to space 
which is true 
i'd pay a million pounds or more to go for an hour 
or even half an hour 
although a day would be better 
a day in space 
that would be something 
a day in space 
that would be something 

and i speak to people sometimes 
and i ask them 
well what would you do if you had a million pounds? 
if you wouldn't take it to space what would you do with it? 
they say i dunno 
buy a house or a car 
maybe take a holiday somewhere 
"a holiday where?" i ask them 
oh spain, egypt 
see the pyramids maybe 
see the pyramids maybe 

when they say this to me i look at them 
i look them straight in the eye 
and i wait for just a few seconds 
just so they know what i'm going to say is going to be important 
what i'm going to say is going to be important 
and then i say 
what better place could you go to than space? 
what's a better holiday than that? 
think about lying there when your a hundered 
a hundred and ten or whatever 
looking back on your life and thinking 
well what did i actually do 
what did i actually achieve 
"oh i saw the pyramids"
big deal! 
you can apparently see those from space anyway 
you can see all the rest of the blue and green globe twisting and turning below you 
you can see the sun lighting up the moon 
you can feel the stars shining down upon your back 

you dont get that in egypt 
and you don't get that at the pyramids 
and you don't get that by pissing away your million pounds on something 
that everyone else can do if they save up long enough 

and the world turns 
and the world turns 
and the world turns 
and the world turns
