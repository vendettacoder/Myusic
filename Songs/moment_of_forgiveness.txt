well i guess that i was lonely
that's why i called you on the phone
cause in a moment of forgiveness i didn't wanna be alone
and i guess that i was willing, more than i ever was before
cause in a moment of forgiveness i come a knockin' at your door

baby i woke up cryin last night just to realize that you were gone
has it been two long years without you, tell me, 
when are you gonna come home?

i guess that i was hoping that you'd finally understand
and in a moment of forgiveness you'd reach out and take my hand

now baby i know you're not one for baring witness
(baby i know)
and you told me that one wrong move is gonna sell you out
(one wrong move)
and i see that you kept your word
(see that you kept your word)
and made it harder than it had to be
wish i could save you the trouble babe
(oh, oh , oh)
give you a little pice of mind

baby i woke up cryin' last night just to realize that you were gone
it's been two long years without you, 
when are you gonna come home?

guess that i was hoping that you'd finally understand
and in a moment of forgiveness you'd reach out and take my hand

and in a moment of forgiveness you'd reach out and take my hand
