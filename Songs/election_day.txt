i meant to close the polls
in the chill night, bitter cold
someone close the polls
on a chill night, in the cold

election day
i can't stay
wannabe, wannabe, wannabe, wannabe

i don't care who gets elected
i don't care who gets to find out
i don't care who gets elected
till i find me a one (to love)

wannabe, wannabe, wannabe
election!
election!
i said election!
i don't care
i don't care
our election day
