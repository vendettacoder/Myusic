drivin' on 9
you could be a shadow
beneath the streetlight
behind my home

drivin' on 9
i sure miss you
pass a motel
looking in the blinds

drivin' on 9
looking for the 30
maybe i passed it
i'll go another mile

drivin' on 9

i sure look pretty
carson city
walking down the aisle
drivin' on 9
does daddy have a shotgun?
he said he'd never need one
go another mile

drivin' on 9

drivin' on 9
looking out my window sill
wondering if i want you still
wondering what's mine
