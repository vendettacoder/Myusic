i said who's that girl there?
i wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards, i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance, i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offenses

and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know?

although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
oh, you know he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be, what his story might be

yeah, 'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down around here
around here, oh

look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous?
and he don't even have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
it don't stop in the winter, no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down around here
around here

what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
