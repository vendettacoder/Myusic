i never see
the people i know
in the bright light of day
so how can i say

that you're any friend of mine
(see you anytime)
i'm feelin' fine
(midnight 'til six)
that's my time
(that's your time)

midnight, midnight 'til six...

i sleep through the day
i wake around four
but i always feel down
never get off the floor

'til the night comes around
(see you downtown)
take in some sounds
(maybe we'll score)
tell me some more
(tell him some more)

(see you down town)
take in some sounds
(maybe we'll score)
tell me some more
(tell him some more)

midnight, midnight 'til six...
