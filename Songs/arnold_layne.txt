arnold layne had a strange hobby
collecting clothes
moonshine, washing line
they suit him fine

on the wall hung a tall mirror
distorted view
see-through baby blue
he dug it

oh arnold layne, it's not the same
takes two to know
two to know
two to know
two to know
why can't you see

arnold layne
arnold layne
arnold layne

now he's caught, a nasty sort of person
they gave him time
doors bang, chain gang
he hates it

oh arnold layne, it's not the same
takes two to know
two to know
two to know
two to know
why can't you see

arnold layne
arnold layne
arnold layne
arnold layne don't do it again
