reflects in the sky warn you you're gonna die
storm coming, you better hide from the atomic tide
flashes in the sky turns houses into sty
turns people into clay, radiation minds decay

robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic graves
plastic flowers, melting sun fading moon falls apart
dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration
burning globe of obscene fire like electric funeral pyre

buildings crashing down to earth's cracking ground
rivers turn to wood, ice melt into blood

earth lies in debris, clouds cry for the dead
terrifying rain ease the burning pain

electric funeral, electric funeral
electric funeral, electric funeral

and so in the sky shines the electric eye
supernatural king takes earth under his wing
heaven's golden chorus sings, hell's angels flap their wings
evil souls fall to hell ever trapped in burning cell
