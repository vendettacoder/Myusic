i stand still stepping on a shady street
and i watch that man to a stranger
think you only know me when you turn on the light
now the room is lit red danger

complicating, circulating
new life, new life
operating, generating
new life, new life

transition to another place
so that time will pass more slowly
your features fuse and your shadow's red
like a film i've seen, now show me

complicating, circulating
new life, new life
operating, generating
new life, new life

the place is hidden and we're out of sight
and the road just leads to nowhere
the stranger in the door is the same as before
so the question answer's nowhere

complicating, circulating
new life, new life
operating, generating
new life, new life

i stand still stepping on a shady street
and i watch that man to a stranger
think you only know me when you turn on the light
now the room is lit red danger

complicating, circulating
new life, new life
operating, generating
new life, new life
