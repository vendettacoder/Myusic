i once knew a man
been everywhere in the world
gave me a tiny ivory ball
said it would bring me good
never believed it would until
i have been loving you

dear old man
he'd seen most everything
gave me a piece of good advice
said it would do me well
i couldn't really tell until
i have been loving you

now it seems
things are not so strange
i can see more clearly
suddenly i've found my way

i know the old man would laugh
he spoke of love's sweeter days
and in his eloquent way
i think he was speaking of you

you are so lovely
you didn't have to say a thing
but i remember that old man
telling me he'd seen the light
gave me a small brown leather book
insisted that he was right
i only heard him slightly
till i heard you whisper
took you up all in my arms

dear old man
wise old man
fine old man, now
