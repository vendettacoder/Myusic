monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
tell your mum what to expect, she says it's right out of the blue
do you went to work in debenham's, because that's what they expect
start in lingerie, and doris is your supervisor

and the head said that you always were a queer one from the start
for careers you say you went to be remembered for your art
your obsessions get you known throughout the school for being strange
making life-size models of the velvet underground in clay

in the queue for lunch they take the piss, you've got no appetite
and the rumour is you never go with boys and you are tight
so they jab you with a fork, you drop the tray and go berserk
while you're cleaning up the mess the teacher's looking up your skirt

hey, you been used
are you calm? settle down
write a song, i'll sing along
soon you will know that you are sane
you're on top of the world again

monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
tell your mum what to expect, she said it's right out of the blue
you went to work in c&amp;a, 'cause that's what they expect
move to lingerie and take a feel off joe the storeman

tell veronica the secrets of the boy you never kissed
she's got everything to gain 'cause she's a fat girl with a lisp
she sticks up for you when you get aggravation from the snobs
'cause you can't afford a blazer, girl, you're always wearing clogs

at the interval you lock yourself away inside a room
head of english gets you, asks you, "what the hell do you think you're doing?
"do you think you're better then the other kids? well get outside."
you've got permission - you've got to make the bastard think he's right

hey, you been used
write a song, i'll sing along
are you calm? settle down
soon you will know that you are sane
you're on top of the world again

oh you're cool and you know
you're a star and you'll go far
listen to me as a friend
not just a boy who plays guitar
you're on top of the world again
