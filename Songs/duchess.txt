duch of the terrace never grew up
i hope she never will
broken down tv sits in the corner
picture's standing still
standing still

duch of the terrace knows all her heritage
says she's henry's kid
knows all the history in her family
needs a man, god forbid!
god forbid!

and it sounds like an empty house
standing still
and it's quieter than a mouse
standing still

duch of the terrace never grew up
i hope she never will
says she's an heiress, sits in her terrace

says she's got time to kill
time to kill

and the rodney's are queuing up
god forbid!
and they all want to win the cup
god forbid!

duchess - duchess 
duchess - duchess 
duchess - duchess 

and the rodney's are queuing up
god forbid!
and the rodney's are queuing up
god forbid!
and the rodney's are queuing up
god forbid!
