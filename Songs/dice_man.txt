i am the dice man
and i take a chance, huh
do you take a chance, huh?



where you two going?
where you two going?
is this a branch on the tree of showbusiness?



do all these musicians
have a social conscience?
well, only in their front rooms



but i am the dice man
and i take a chance man
do you take a chance, huh?



they stay with the masses
don't take any chances
end up emptying ashtrays



but i push, push, push, push
throw the bones and the poison dice
no time for small moralists



cos i am the dice man
and i take a chance, huh
do you take a chance, fan?



they say music should be fun
like reading a story of love
but i wanna read a horror story
where are you people going?
where are you people going?
is this a branch on the tree of showbusiness?



but i am the dice man
a balls-on-the-line man
do you take a chance, baby?
