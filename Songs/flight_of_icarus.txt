as the sun breaks above the ground
an old man stands on the hill
as the ground warms to the first rays of light
a birdsong shatters the still

his eyes are a blaze
see the madman in his gaze

fly on your way like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly and touch the sun, yeah, mmm

now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
looks the old man in the eye
as he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"in the name of god my father i'll fly."

his eyes seem so glazed
as he flies on the wings of a dream
now he knows his father betrayed
now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

fly on your way like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly, touch the sun

yeah, fly on your way like an eagle
fly as high as the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly as high as the sun

on your way, like an eagle
fly, touch the sun
on your way, like an eagle
fly

fly as high as the sun
