the dream police, they live inside of my head
the dream police, they come to me in my bed
the dream police, they're coming to arrest me
oh no!

you know that talk is cheap
and those rumors ain't nice
and when i fall asleep
i don't think i'll survive the night, the night

'cause they're waiting for me
they're looking for me
every single night they're driving me insane
those men inside my brain

the dream police, they live inside of my head (live inside of my head)
the dream police, they come to me in my bed (come to me in my bed)
the dream police, they're coming to arrest me
oh no!

well, i can't tell lies
'cause they're listening to me
and when i fall asleep
bet they're spying on me tonight, tonight

'cause they're waiting for me
they're looking for me
ev'ry single night they're driving me insane
those men inside my brain

i try to sleep, they're wide awake, they won't let me alone
they don't get paid to take vacations or let me alone
they spy on me, i try to hide, they won't let me alone
they persecute me, they're the judge and jury all in one

'cause they're waiting for me
they're looking for me
ev'ry single night they're driving me insane
those men inside my brain

the dream police, they live inside of my head (live inside of my head)
the dream police, they come to me in my bed (come to me in my bed)
the dream police, they're coming to arrest me

the dream police (police, police)
the dream police (police, police)
the dream police (police, police)
the dream police (police, police)
