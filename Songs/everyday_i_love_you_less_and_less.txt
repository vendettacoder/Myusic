everyday i love you less and less
it's clear to see that you've become obsessed
i got to get this message to the press
that everyday i love you less and less
and everyday i love you less and less
i've got to get this feeling off my chest
the doctor says all i need is pills and rest
since everyday i love you less and less

unless, unless, i know, i feel it in my bones
i'm sick, i'm tired of staying in control
oh yes, i feel, a rat upon a wheel
i got to know what's not and what is real
oh yes, i'm stressed, i'm sorry i digress
impressed, you dressed to s.o.s.
ooh, and my parents love me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
ooh, and my girlfriend loves me, ooh (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

everyday i love you less and less
i can't believe once you and me did sex
it makes me sick to think of you undressed
since everyday i love you less and less
and everyday i love you less and less
you're turning into something i detest
and everybody says that you're a mess
since everyday i love you less and less

unless, unless, i know, i feel it in my bones
i'm sick i'm tired of staying in control
oh yes, i feel, a rat upon a wheel
i got to know what's not and what is real
oh yes, i'm stressed, i'm sorry i digress
impressed, you dressed to s.o.s.
ooh, and my parents love me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
ooh, and my girlfriend loves me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
