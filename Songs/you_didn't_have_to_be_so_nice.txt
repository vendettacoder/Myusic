you didn't have to be so nice
i would have liked you anyway
if you had just looked once or twice
and gone upon your quiet way

today i said the time was right for me to follow you
i knew i'd find you in a day or two
and it's true

you came upon a quiet day
you simply seemed to take your place
i knew that it would be that way
the minute that i saw your face

and when we've had a few more days (when we've had a few more days)
i wonder if i'll get to say (wonder if i'll get to say)
you didn't have to be so nice (be so nice)
i would have liked you anyway (would have liked)

today i said the time was right for me to follow you (today, said that the time was right to follow you)
i knew i'd find you in a day or two (i knew that i would find you in a day or two)
and it's true

you didn't have to be so nice (didn't have to be so nice)
i would have liked you anyway (would have liked you anyway)
