i like flying
flying kites, flying kites, flying kites
kites are fun, kites are fun, kites are fun

see my kite, it's fun
see my kite, it's green and white
laughing in its distant flight
all that's between us is a little yellow string
but we like each other more than anything
and we run along together through the field behind my house
and the little drops of rain caress our face and wash my blouse
and we'd like to be a zillion miles away from everyone
cause mom and dad and uncle bill don't realise

kites are fun, kites are fun, kites are fun
kites are fun
