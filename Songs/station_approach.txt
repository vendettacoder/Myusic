i haven't been myself of late
i haven't slept for several days
but coming home i feel like i
designed these buildings i walk by

you know you drive me up the wall
i need to see your face that's all
you little sod, i love your eyes
be everything to me tonight
be everything to me tonight

i never know what i want but i know when i'm low that i
i need to be in the town where they know what i'm like and don't mind
i never know what i want but i know when i'm low that i
i need to be in the town where they know what i'm like and don't mind

i never know what i want but i know when i'm low that i
i need to be in the town where they know what i'm like and don't mind
i never know what i want but i know when i'm low that i
i need to be in the town where they know what i'm like and don't mind

i never know what i want but i know when i'm low that i
i need to be in the town where they know what i'm like and don't mind
i never know what i want but i know when i'm low that i
i need to be in the town where they know what i'm like and don't mind

the streets are full of goths and greeks
i haven't seen my mum for weeks
but coming home i feel like i
designed the buildings i walk by

you know you drive me up the wall
i need to see your face is all
you little sod, i love your eyes
be everything to me tonight
be everything to me tonight
