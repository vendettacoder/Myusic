the hospital wouldn't admit you
so we go home again
right back to the same old room
right back to the same old thing 

but you know you're just another girl 
come from some carry-out in hell 
you're just another story how they fucked up the life 
of a sweet girl 

we'll sit and look at the street 
watch the el dorados roll by 
you can't look your murderers 
you can't look them in the eye 

but you know they can always spot you 
from a mile away 
they give you anything you want 
they'll do anything you say 

and outside this bar there's no one alive 
outside this bar how does anyone survive 
together you and me  
you know we've gotta destroy this world 
c'mon darling we've gotta destroy this world 

and i remember when 
your girlfriend would put you on display 
you'd be the life of the party 
til they come and drag you away 

but in the end we'll watch the pattern 
as it begins to tear 
we'll see the chaos that's underneath 
all the clothes that the angels wear 

and outside this bar there's no one alive 
outside this bar how does anyone survive 
together you and me  
you know we'll never destroy this world 
c'mon baby i wish we could destroy this world 
outside this bar 

together you and me turn this quiet night into silence 
together we'll turn this love into violence
