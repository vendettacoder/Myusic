conrad's mother said conrad dear
i must go out and leave you here.
but mind now, conrad, what i say,
don't suck your thumbs while i'm away.

snip! snip

that great tall tailor, he always comes
for naughty boys who suck their thumbs
and ere they wonder what he's about,
he's got his great long scissors out.

snip snip the scissors go
and conrad cries out oh!
snip snip they go so fast,
and conrad's thumbs are off at last.

well,mama had scarcely turned her back,
when the thumbs were in , alack! alack!
the door burst open and in he ran,
that great long legged scissor man.

snip snip the scissors go
and conrad cries out oh!
snip snip they go so fast,
and conrad's thumbs are off at last.

well, mama comes home and there conrad stands,
and he looks quite sad as he shows his hands,
ha! ha! said mama, i knew he'd come,
for naughty little suck-a-thumb.

chorus and conrad breathes his last.
chorus and conrad bleeds to death at last.
