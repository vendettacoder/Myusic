what have we done with innocence
it disappeared with time, it never made much sense
adolescent resident
wasting another night on planning my revenge

one in ten
one in ten
one in ten

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench

all this time to make amends
what do you do when all your enemies are friends
now and then i'll try to bend
under the pressure wind up snapping in the end

one in ten
one in ten
one in ten

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench

temper
temper
temper

one last thing before i quit
i never wanted any more than i could fit into my head
i still remember every single word you said
and all the shit that somehow came along with it
still there's one thing that comforts me
since i was always caged and now i'm free

don't want to be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
i'd rather leave than suffer this
i'll never be your monkey wrench

don't want to be your monkey wrench
(fall in, fall out)
don't want to be your monkey wrench
(fall in, fall out)
don't want to be your monkey wrench
(fall in, fall out)
don't want to be your monkey wrench
