drinking in the morning sun
blinking in the morning sun
shaking off a heavy one
heavy like a loaded gun

what made me behave that way?
using words i never say
i can only think it must be love
oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

someone tell me how i feel
it's silly wrong, but vivid right
oh, kiss me like a final meal
yeah, kiss me like we die tonight

'cause holy cow, i love your eyes
and only now i see the light
yeah, lying with you half awake
oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

when my face is chamois creased
if you think i wink, i did
laugh politely at repeats
yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin

'cause holy cow, i love your eyes
and only now i see the light
yeah, lying with you half awake
stumbling over what to say
well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

so throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right

throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right for life

throw those curtains wide  'cause holy cow, i love your eyes
one day like this a year would see me right and only now i see the light
throw those curtains wide  'cause holy cow, i love your eyes
one day like this a year would see me right and only now i see the light

throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right

throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right

throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right

throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
throw those curtains wide
one day like this a year would see me right
