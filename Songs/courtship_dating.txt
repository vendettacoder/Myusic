how do i feel for thee
your smile brings disease
cause we're young, fell in from the stars

when your skin is shed
find a pile of your head
now then, i'll look so smart

stove burns on my hand
show them to my friends
make you participate

eyes roll back around
limbs fall to the ground
seasoned to procreate

the first to interfere
are culled before the deer
when they wander into the cage

stuff their arms and thighs
then they roll their cardboard eyes
their skin will never age
