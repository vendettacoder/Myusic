speed leaving without warning
i need some place to sleep tonight
blowing in the rocking of the pine

speed leaving without warning
the sunlight is going

into the mountain
i will crawl
into the mountain

sun shines in the rusty morning
skyline of the olympus mons
i think about it sometimes

sun shines in the rusty morning
once i had a good fly

into the mountain
i will fall
into the mountain
oh yeah

into the mountain
i will fall
into the mountain
oh yeah

into the mountain
i will fall
i will fall
