flat block
of two dimensions
neon tote board to the sky
keeping scores of people stacked up so high
above the ground
that all they can hear is the sound
of the wind in the antennae
it's a human zoo
a suicide machine

childhood
of concrete cube-shaped
a flypaper stuck with human life
caged up rage
swarming hornet hive
tear out the telephones
rip out the pages of directories
and wreck all these
high speed lifts and elevators
be a sabotage rebel without applause

high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
you're all stacked up in a high rise block

high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
all stacked up in a high rise block

starfish
of human blood shape
the tentacles of human gore
spread out on the pavement from the 99th floor
well, somebody said he jumped
but we know he was pushed
and he was just like you might have been
on the 99th floor of a suicide machine

high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
all stacked up in a high rise block

high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
all stacked up in a high rise block

high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
living in a high rise
high rise
all stacked up in a high rise block
