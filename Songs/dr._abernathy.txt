i wonder how i'm feeling now
i don't suppose i should have chosen
that stuff how much is enough
i don't quite hear the dime drop
the buck stop or the bells

i stole a glance at circumstance
it's way too big for them to figure
outside in the exercise yard
the three winds blow, the dear john
it won't be long round and round

punks jump up
to get beat down all the days
of my life, love

dr. abernathy called to see if you were here
he wanted heroin i gave him beer
dr. abernathy called to see if you were in
he wanted mescaline i gave him gin

dr. abernathy, the owl of minerva
so long but i know

i finished it on saturday, i started in july
another reference for me to try
dr. abernathy called to see if you were here
the news is terrible, you're in the clear

suzy sack it to me, the owl of minerva
so long but i know

daddy had a rabbit skin to wrap a little baby in
he took her to the jersey shore
please don't go away i'll wait for you to say 'you do'
please don't go away i'll wait for you to say 'you do'

leaves'll blow away, skies'll go from blue to gray
here we go again

dr. abernathy called to see if you were here
for meth amphetatmine for volunteers
dr. abernathy called to see if you were in
he wanted liquorice and for my sins

dr. abernathy, the owl of minerva
so long but i know

i start again on saturday and finish in july
a look of wonderment i wonder why
dr. abernathy called to see if you were here
the news is terrible you're in the clear

suzy sack it to me, the owl of minerva
so long but i know

daddy had a rabbit skin to wrap a little baby in
he took her to the jersey shore
please don't go away i'd love for you to stay too long
please don't go away i'd love for me to prove you wrong

leaves'll blow away, skies'll go from blue to gray
here we go again

i wonder how i'm feeling now
make no mistake, my time has taken too long
to late put wrong, i don't quite see the stoplight
to turn right, all is well

i stole a glance at circumstance
it's way too big for them to figure
outside in the exercise yard
the three winds blow, the dear john
it won't be long round and round

the punks jump up
to get beat down all the days
of my life, love
