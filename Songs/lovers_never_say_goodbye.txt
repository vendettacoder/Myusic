please wait for me; for i shall return;
my love for you will forever burn
though we must part;
there's no reason to cry
just say so long;
because lovers never say goodbye

i love you;
my darling more than life itself
i wouldn't try to hurt you;
for i'd only be hurting my self

just kiss me dear;
and hold me tight;
for you know this is not our last night
though we must part;
there's no reason to cry
just say so long;
because lovers never say goodbye
