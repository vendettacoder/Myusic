whoopa, hey mesa, hooba huffa, hey meshy goosh goosh.

looking at the world through the sunset in your eyes
travelling the train through clear moroccan skies
ducks and pigs and chickens call
animal carpet wall to wall
american ladies five-foot tall in blue

sweeping cobwebs from the edges of my mind
had to get away to see what we could find
hope the days that lie ahead
bring us back to where they've led
listen not to what's been said to you

wouldn't you know we're riding on the marrakesh express
wouldn't you know we're riding on the marrakesh express
they're taking me to marrakesh
all aboard the train
all aboard the train

i've been saving all my money just to take you there
i smell the garden in your hair

take the train from casablanca going south
blowing smoke rings from the corners of my mouth
colored cottons hang in the air
charming cobras in the square
striped djellebas we can wear at home
well, let me hear ya now

wouldn't you know we're riding on the marrakesh express
wouldn't you know we're riding on the marrakesh express
they're taking me to marrakesh

wouldn't you know we're riding on the marrakesh express
wouldn't you know we're riding on the marrakesh express
they're taking me to marrakesh
all aboard the train
all aboard the train
all aboard, ooh
