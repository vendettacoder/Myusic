i want him, and i need him
and someday someday wooo i'll meet him
he'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too
and i'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do..

like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
and wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
and being so in love

when he's near me, i'll kiss him,
and when he leaves me woo i'll miss him
though somethimes we'll fight, i won't really care
and i'll know it's gonna be alright cause we've got so much we share

like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
and wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
and being so in love

(johnny) no no he'll never do
(bobby) no it isn't him too
they would never no they'd never never ever love
walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)
and wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
and being so in love

oh oh oh where can he be oh oh
