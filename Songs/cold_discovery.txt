i know your teeth have gnashed through death
still you come to me
so gently
find a soft place on your body
and rub me with it
oh, this i won't soon forget
you're the one that will remain
you're the one that will remain

bust a lock with a rock
don't need a key to have me
this was your cold discovery

we needed a fever, we needed a cure
the bait no longer lured
say goodbye, quick as you can
the car waits for me
just across the border
wish me luck, no good luck
no bad luck, just wish me luck
with my cold discovery

you are gone
my cold discovery
you're the one that will remain

well, i can hold a woman down on a hardwood floor
well, i can hold a woman down on a hardwood floor
and your teeth can gnash right through me
looking for a soft place
and of this you won't soon forget
i had no soft place for you to rest
and this was your, your cold discovery
your cold discovery

well, i can hold a woman down on a hardwood floor
well, i can hold a woman down on a hardwood floor
this was my, my cold discovery
my cold discovery

if you saw it for what it really was
my cold discovery
my cold discovery
my cold discovery
