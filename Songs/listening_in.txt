i was sitting on my own
no-one there till i picked up the phone
and then i heard your voice
i was listening in

you were talking in the hall
i wasn't there but i heard it all
nothing i could do
just listening in

on the carpet you're so small
he had you covered wall to wall
nothing i could do
just listening in

now you're gone and your line's dead
nothing i can do instead
no more, no more
no more listening in
