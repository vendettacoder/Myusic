my new year's resolution (check 1, 2)
this is my new year's resolution (check 1, 2)
spontaneous freestyles are the solution (check 1, 2)
"crazy hip hop (check 1, 2) and you don't stop"

don't believe what you believe or believe what you believe
and end up being those mc's who be leaving
don't believe what you believe, believe what you believe
and end up being those mc's who be leaving

chorus: 

for the new year i swear, this rhyme be rare when you hear
a madlib drum, bass kick, snare
wild child compiles styles down for your ear
lp for you and yours, loud and clear

(madlib)
when the first lootpack era began a demo tape was formed
unexpectedly, wack a&amp;r's swarmed and started a cosmic storm
everywhere i turned got burned thus learned i must earn
full acknowledgement of this whole rap game on my own
realizing i couldn't get mad at labels, labels weren't able
to see the rhythmic era wild child was throwing at the table
i said, honestly, i couldn't get mad at a little blind person
who would sleep on a lootpack lp and ask me to define versing
i defy rehearsing, specifically i defy all those who apply cursing
to their limited freestyles they kick
when it's time to unlock those lyrical glock flows, i dip dip dive
madlib rush from the left as we kick ish live

i can rhyme, (oh yes i can rhyme)
a spontaneous freestylin' rhyme
(spontaneous freestylin' rhyme)
i just concentrate on my ish (concentrate on my ish)
cuz i got props to get (yes mad props to get)

chorus: 

for the new year i swear, this rhyme be rare when you hear
a madlib drum, bass kick, snare
wild child compiles styles down for your ear
lp for you and yours, loud and clear

(wild child)
there's no advantage one gains when sustaining two faces
the disadvantage of being two-faced, you can't be in two places
now who races against the law of physics supplying logic?
you can't avoid being destroyed by wild child, so why dodge it?
when it comes to dropping freestyles, wild child front and center
like jack nicholson at laker games, it's time for the pack to enter
an atmosphere where most record labels be making clones
preprogramming their artists so it's like it's all about making bones
i'm the type of mc to drop rhymes with the unexpected
come with some unstereotype of rhymes that mad unpredicted
that type of artist, pointing out mc's who try to be the hardest
props to the jackson family for the influence they've taught us

cuz i can rhyme, (oh yes i can rhyme)
a spontaneous freestylin' rhyme
(spontaneous freestylin' rhyme)
i just concentrate on my ish (concentrate on my ish)
cuz i got props to get (yes mad props to get)

chorus: 

for the new year i swear, this rhyme be rare when you hear
a madlib drum, bass kick, snare
wild child compiles styles down for your ear
lp for you and yours, loud and clear

don't believe what you believe, believe what you believe
and end up being those mc's who be leaving
don't believe what you believe, believe what you believe
and end up being those mc's who be leaving
