there's my favorite rollercoaster
next to the blue water
the one only sissies ride
there's the sun
going down
creating that florescent glow
reminding me i'll never be able
to relive this day
except in memory

there's those big barking fish
in the concrete stream
growling for dog food
bulging dead eyes that gleam
but where's dad?
and where is mom?
looks like from here on out
it's just me and you
looks like from here on out
it's just me and you
