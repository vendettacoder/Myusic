we come on the sloop john b
my grandfather and me
around nassau town we did roam
drinking all night
got into a fight
well, i feel so broke up
i want to go home

so hoist up the john b's sail
see how the mainsail sets
call for the captain ashore
let me go home
let me go home
i wanna go home, yeah, yeah
well, i feel so broke up
i wanna go home

the first mate he got drunk
and broke in the captain's trunk
the constable had to come and take him away
sheriff john stone
why don't you leave me alone? yeah, yeah
well, i feel so broke up
i wanna go home

so hoist up the john b's sail
see how the mainsail sets
call for the captain ashore
let me go home
let me go home
i wanna go home
let me go home
why don't you let me go home?
(hoist up the john b's sail)
hoist up the john b
well, i feel so broke up
i wanna go home
let me go home

the poor cook he caught the fits
and threw away all my grits
and then he took and he ate up all of my corn
let me go home
why don't they let me go home?
this is the worst trip
i've ever been on

so hoist up the john b's sail
see how the mainsail sets
call for the captain ashore
let me go home
let me go home
i wanna go home
let me go home
why don't you let me go home?
