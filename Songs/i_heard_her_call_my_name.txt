here she comes now, now
she's gone, gone, gone
ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
got my eyes wide open

ever since i was on cripples monday
got my eyeballs on my knees
aww my baby walkin' after hours with mad mary williams
said she never understood a word from me because

i know that she cares about me
i heard her call my name (heard her call my name)
and i know that she's long dead and gone (heard her call my name)
still it ain't the same (heard her call my name)

when i wake up in this morning, mama (heard her call my name)
i heard her call my name (heard her call my name)
i know that she's gone, gone, gone (heard her call my name)
i heard her call my name and then my mind split open

here she comes now, now
she's gone, gone, gone
ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
got my eyes wide open

ever since i was on cripples monday
got my eyeballs on my knees
after hours with mad mary williams
said she never understood a word from me

i know that she cares about me
i heard her call my name (heard her call my name)
and i said that she's long dead and gone (heard her call my name)
still she ain't the same (heard her call my name)

when i woke up in the morning, mama (heard her call my name)
i heard her call my name, no, no (heard her call my name)
i know that she's gone, gone, gone (heard her call my name)
still i heard her call my name and then my mind split open
