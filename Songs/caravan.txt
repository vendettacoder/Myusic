night and stars above that shine so bright 
the myst'ry of their fading light 
that shines upon our caravan 

sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
across the sand so i may keep 
the mem'ry of our caravan 

this is so exciting 
you are so inviting 
resting in my arms 
as i thrill to the magic charms 
of you beside me here beneath the blue 
my dream of love is coming true 
within our desert caravan
