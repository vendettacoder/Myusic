of all i knew
i held too few
and would you stop me
if i tried to stop you?

old songs stay till the end
sad songs remind me of friends
and the way that it is, i could leave it all
and i ask myself: would you care at all?

when i drive alone at night
i see the street lights as fair grounds
and i've tried a hundred times
to see the road signs as day-glo

old songs stay till the end
sad songs remind me of friends
and the way that it is, i could leave it all
and i ask myself: would you care at all?
