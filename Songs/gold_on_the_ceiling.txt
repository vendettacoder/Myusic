down in the waves 
she screams again 
roar at the door 
my mind can't take much more 
i could never drown 

they wanna get my 
they wanna get my 
gold on the ceiling 
i ain't blind 
just a matter of time 
before you steal it 
it's alright 
ain't no blood in my eye

clouds covered love's 
barbed-wired fence 
strung up, strung out 
i just can't go without 

i could never drown 

they wanna get my 
they wanna get my 
gold on the ceiling 
i ain't blind 
just a matter of time 
before you steal it 
it's alright 
ain't no blood in my eye 

they wanna get my 
they wanna get my 
gold on the ceiling 
i ain't blind 
just a matter of time 
before you steal it 
it's alright 
ain't no blood in my eye
gold on the ceiling 
i ain't blind 
just a matter of time 
before you steal it 
it's alright 
ain't no blood in my eye
