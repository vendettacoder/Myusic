avast! they're leaving town two by two,
as the rain pours down and we're all soaked through
and as they march away, two by two,
it's like we need an ark for the rest of us

so i'll cut my hair short 
and i'll make a flag from an old black dress that i'd have worn 
if it hadn't rained so much that the
seven hills became seven seas
and i'll sail my house from broomhill to walkley

pretty polly is a pigeon, she's got a gammy leg and she'll eat anything
i've got an eye patch with a hole in cos i don't need to navigate by stars - i use the road signs and the arts tower
still the rains come

so i'll cut my hair short 
and i'll make a flag from an old black dress that i'd have worn 
if it hadn't rained so much that the
seven hills became seven seas
and i'll sail my house from crookes to don valley

you can be my cabin boy and i can be your long lost pal
i can call you eddie, and eddie when you call me you can call me captain

so i'll cut my hair short 
and i'll make a flag from an old black dress that i'd have worn 
if it hadn't rained so much that the
seven hills became seven seas
and i'll sail my house from fulwood to high green
