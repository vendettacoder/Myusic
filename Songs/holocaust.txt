your eyes are almost dead
can't get out of bed
and you can't sleep

you're sitting down to dress
and you're a mess
you look in the mirror

you look in your eyes
say you realize

everybody goes
leaving those who fall behind
everybody goes
as far as they can,
they don't just care.

they stood on the stairs
laughing at your errors
your mother's dead
she said, "don't be afraid"

your mother's dead
you're on your own
she's in her bed

everybody goes
leaving those who fall behind
everybody goes
as far as they can
they don't just care
you're a wasted face
you're a sad-eyed lie
you're a holocaust.
