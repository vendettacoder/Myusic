i'm so tired
of playing
playing with this bow and arrow
gonna give my heart away
leave it to the other girls to play
for i've been a temptress too long
just

give me a reason to love you
give me a reason to be
a woman
i just wanna be a woman

from this time, unchained
we're all looking at a different picture
through this new frame of mind
a thousand flowers could bloom
move over, and give us some room
yeah

give me a reason to love you
give me a reason to be
a woman
i just wanna be a woman

so don't you stop bein' a man
just take a little look from our side when you can
sow a little tenderness
no matter if you cry

give me a reason to love you
give me a reason to be here
a woman
it's all i wanna be is a woman

for this is the beginning of forever and ever
its time to move over

i'm so tired, of playing
playing with this bow and arrow
gonna give my heart away
leave it to the other girls to play
for i've been a temptress too long
