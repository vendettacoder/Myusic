coming down, sadie i love it
now, now, now, death valley '69

you're right
you're right
you're right
you're right
you're right

i was on the wrong track
we're deep in the valley
how deep in the gulley
and now in the canyon (and now in the canyon)
way out in the yonder (way out in the yonder)
she started to holler
she started to holler

i didn't wanna
i didn't wanna
i didn't wanna
i didn't wanna
but she started to holler

so i had to hit it
hit it
hit it
hit it

deep in the valley
in the trunk of an old car
in the back of a chevy
i got sand in my mouth
and you got sun in your eyes blinded
and you wanted to get there
but i couldn't go faster
i couldn't go faster
so i started to hit it
so i started to hit it
and i started to hit it

hit it
hit it
hit it
hit it

hit it
hit it
hit it
hit it

coming down, sadie i love it
now, now, now, death valley '69
death valley '69, death valley '69
death valley '69
