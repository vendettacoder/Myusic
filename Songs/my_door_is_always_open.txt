i will only, let you down.
i will only, let you down.
but my door, is always open.
yeah my door, is always open.

well i don't think, that i ever loved you.
but the world is dying to meet you.
oh black birds they sing off the mountains.
joyous love songs that drift through the houses.

but now i'm free,
now i'm free,
now i'm free from all your pain.

oh well church bells, they are ringing for you.
oh and choirs are singing in red,
oh your voice could summon the angels,
and your beauty, could waken the dead.

but now i'm free,
now i'm free,
now i'm free from all your pain.

well you have only let me down
you have only, let me down
but my door is always open
yeah my door is always open.

yeah i love with my heart and i hold it in my hands,
but you know, my heart's not yours. (4x)
