i've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
i've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil and you lie
and if you should die, i may feel slightly sad but i won't cry

loved and lost and some may say
when usually it's nothing, surely you're happy it should be this way?
i say no, i'm gonna kill my dog
may the lines sag, the lines sag heavy and deep tonight

i've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
i've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil and you lie
and if you should die, i may feel slightly sad but i won't cry

loved and lost and some may say
when usually it's nothing, surely you're happy it should be this way?
i said no and then i shot myself
so drink, drink, drink and be ill tonight

from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind

behind, behind, behind
behind, behind, behind
oh, unhappy birthday
