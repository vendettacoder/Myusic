when i was young i'd listen to the radio
waiting for my favorite songs
when they played i'd sing along
it made me smile

those were such happy times and not so long ago
how i wondered where they'd gone
but they're back again just like a long lost friend
all the songs i loved so well

every shalalala, every oho, oho
still shines
every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
so fine

when they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
it can really make me cry
just like before
it's yesterday once more

looking back on how it was in years gone by
and the good times that i had
makes today seem rather sad
so much has changed

it was songs of love that i would sing to them
and i'd memorize each word
those old melodies still sound so good to me
as they melt the years away

every shalalala, every oho, oho
still shines
every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
so fine

all my best memories come back clearly to me
some can even make me cry
just like before
it's yesterday once more

(shoobidoo, wangdang)
(shoobidoo, wangdang)

every shalalala, every oho, oho
still shines
every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
so fine

every shalalala, every oho, oho
still shines
every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
so fine
