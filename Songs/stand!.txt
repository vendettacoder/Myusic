stand 
in the end you'll still be you 
one that's done all the things you set out to do 
stand 
there's a cross for you to bear 
things to go through if you're going anywhere 
stand 
for the things you know are right 
it s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight 
stand 
all the things you want are real 
you have you to complete and there is no deal 
stand. stand, stand 
stand. stand, stand 
stand 
you've been sitting much too long 


there's a permanent crease in your right and wrong 
stand 
there's a midget standing tall 
and the giant beside him about to fall 
stand. stand, stand 
stand. stand, stand 
stand 
they will try to make you crawl 
and they know what you're saying makes sense and all 
stand 
don't you know that you are free 
well at least in your mind if you want to be 

everybody 
stand, stand, stand
