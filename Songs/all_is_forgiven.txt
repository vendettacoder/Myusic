heal me darling
pleaded the playboy bedroom eyes
grace your sunshine 
till everyithing's ok, alright, fine

what's hers is his
cause everything is forgiven
forgiven
though he soured the milk of human
kindness all is forgiven (all is forgiven)

truth and avarice
encircle his words like a
barberpole
twisted and useless
till they disappear in her camisole
(goodnight alibi)

throw away your daggers and pills
cause everything's still forgiven
forgiven
though he bit off the nipple of 
human kindness all is forgiven

hypocrite, four flusher, snake in
the grass 
just a swindler and wolf in sheep's
clothing, liar

yes he tries to hide the cross he
bears
but splinters, like the truth have 
always risen
all is forgiven

though he shelters in the 
shade of the wings of a stool pigeon
all is forgiven
