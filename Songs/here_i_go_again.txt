i don't know where i'm going
but i sure know where i've been
hanging on the promises in the songs of yesterday
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time

here i go again
here i go again

though i keep searching for an answer
i never seem to find what i'm looking for
oh lord, i pray you give me strength to carry on\
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams

here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time

i'm just another heart in need of rescue
waiting on love's sweet charity
and i'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams

and here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time

but here i go again
here i go again
here i go again
here i go

'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams

and here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
and i've made up my mind
i ain't wasting no more time

and here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
'cause i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams

and here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
