watch it!

i was born in a crossfire hurricane
and i howled at my ma in the drivin' rain

but it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
but it's all right, i'm jumpin' jack flash
it's a gas, gas, gas

i was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
i was schooled with a strap right across my back

but it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
but it's all right, i'm jumpin' jack flash
it's a gas, gas, gas
ooh

i was drowned, i was washed up and left for dead
i fell down to my feet and i saw they bled, yeah yeah
i frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yeah yeah yeah
i was crowned with a spike right through my head

but it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
but it's all right, i'm jumpin' jack flash
it's a gas, gas, gas

jumping jack flash, it's a gas
jumping jack flash, it's a gas
jumping jack flash, it's a gas
jumping jack flash, it's a gas
jumping jack flash, it's a gas
jumping jack flash, it's a gas
