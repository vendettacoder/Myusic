i would tell you about the things they put me through
the pain i've been subjected to
but the lord himself, oh, would blush
the countless feasts laid at my feet
forbidden fruits for me to eat
but i think your pulse would start to rush

now i'm not looking for absolution
forgiveness for the things i do
but before you come to any conclusions
try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes

you'll stumble in my footsteps
keep the same appointments i kept
if you try walking in my shoes
if you try walking in my shoes

morality would frown upon
decency look down upon
the scapegoat fate's made of me
but i promise now, my judge and jurors
my intentions couldn't have been purer
my case is easy to see

i'm not looking for a clearer conscience
peace of mind after what i've been through
and before we talk of any repentance
try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes

you'll stumble in my footsteps
keep the same appointments i kept
if you try walking in my shoes
if you try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes

now i'm not looking for absolution
forgiveness for the things i do
but before you come to any conclusions
try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes

you'll stumble in my footsteps
keep the same appointments i kept
if you try walking in my shoes
you'll stumble in my footsteps
keep the same appointments i kept
if you try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes
if you try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes
