hope there's someone
who'll take care of me
when i die, will i go?

hope there's someone
who'll set my heart free
nice to hold when i'm tired

there's a ghost on the horizon
when i go to bed
how can i fall asleep at night?
how will i rest my head?

oh i'm scared of the middle place
between light and nowhere
i don't want to be the one
left in there, left in there

there's a man on the horizon
wish that i'd go to bed
if i fall to his feet tonight
will allow rest my head?

so here's hoping i will not drown
or paralyze in light
and godsend i don't want to go
to the seal's watershed

hope there's someone
who'll take care of me
when i die, will i go?

hope there's someone
who'll set my heart free
nice to hold when i'm tired
