kali ma, queen of aeons
our mother
swallow the world
kali ma, in your bossom
kali mother
i seek refuge

kali ma
now it's autumn of the aeons
dance with your sword
now it's time for the harvest
(and to) climb the ladder
mistress of time

let the tounge of her fire burn
sleep on (the) cremation bed
it's autumn of the aeons

end is near, it's nothing to fear
(it's) a beginning of the world

time is spiral, eternal
kundalini in space
kali, the black
with garland of sculls
om krim kali, om krim kali
om krim kali, kali ma

kali ma, bring us nectar (of)
kali yuga
the world is ripe
pick the fruits
cleanse the spirit
kali mother
bathe in her stream

kali black, you're the white one
(you're) sacred water
kali ma
now it's autumn of the aeons
