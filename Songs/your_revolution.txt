yeah yeah, yeah this goes out to all the women and men from new york to
london to la to tokyo struggling to keep their self-respect in this climate
of misogyny, money worship and mass production of hip-hop's illegitimate child,
hip-pop.and this especially goes out to gil scott-heron, friend, living legend
and proto-rapper who wrote &amp;quot;the revolution will not be televised.&amp;quot; much respect.

your revolution will not happen between these thighs
your revolution will not happen between these thighs
your revolution will not happen between these thighs
not happen between these thighs
not happen between these thighs

the real revolution ain't about booty size
the versaces you buys, or the lexus you drives
and though we've lost biggie smalls
baby your notorious revolution
will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush

your revolution will not be killing me softly, with fugees
your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring
and produce little future emcees
because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep

with ll, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well
doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now
your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down
nor will it take you downtown or humpin around
because that revolution will not happen between these thighs

your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one i got
and your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip vd shot
and your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise
or helping you fantasize
because that revolution will not happen between these thighs

no no, not between these thighs
oh, my jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic
and really fantastic
and have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic
you will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla,

butter pecan, chocolate delux
or having akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm
you want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh
think i'm a put it in my mouth, just cuz you made a few bucks?
please brother please

your revolution will not be me tossing my weave
and making me believe i'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown
or me giving up my behind, just so i can get signed
and maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
i'm sarah jones, not foxy brown

you know i'm sarah jones, not foxy brown
your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
if we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
we'd revolt back to our roots, use a little common sense
on a quest to make love de la soul, no pretense

but your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status
to express what you feel
your revolution will not happen between these thighs
will not happen between these thighs
will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking

between these thighs
because the real revolution, that's right i said the real revolution
you know i'm talking about the revolution
when it comes, it's gonna be real
it's gonna be real

it's gonna be real
when it finally comes
when it finally comes
it's gonna be real, yeah yeah
