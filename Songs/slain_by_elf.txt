hey teenagers revolt in hairslides
we're burning out from the inside
we're never sure what is real
in this world (if anything)
hey satan the mall's in chaos
so help us to kill our parents
slain... by elf

slain by elf

we're staying home in our rooms
on our dice
one hundred sides
our physical shells are rotting
this paranoid fear is classic
slain... by elf

slain by elf

we go to school with creeps and ghouls
it's over now
these trailer trash have got no cash
poor baby now
we got so bored of our boards
we'll slay you
wow, wow

slain by elf
