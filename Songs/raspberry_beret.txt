yeah

i was working part time in a five-and-dime
my boss was mr. mcgee
he told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'cause i was a bit too leisurely

seems that i was busy doing something close to nothing
but different than the day before
that's when i saw her, ooh, i saw her 
she walked in through the out door, out door

she wore a
raspberry beret
the kind you find in a second hand store
raspberry beret
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
raspberry beret
i think i love her

built like she was
she had the nerve to ask me
if i planned to do her any harm

so, look here
i put her on the back of my bike
and a we went riding
down by old man johnson's farm

i said now, overcast days never turned me on
but something about the clouds and her mixed

she wasn't too bright
but i could tell when she kissed me
she knew how to get her kicks

she wore a 
raspberry beret
the kind you find in a second hand store
raspberry beret
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
raspberry beret
i think i love her

the rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
and the horses wonder who you are
thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
you feel like a movie star

listen
they say the first time ain't the greatest
but i tell ya
if i had the chance to do it all again

i wouldn't change a stroke
'cause baby i'm the most
with a girl as fine as she was then

(raspberry beret)
the kind you find (the kind you find)
the kind you find (in a second hand store)
oh no no

(raspberry beret)
(and if it was warm)
where have all the raspberry women gone? (she wouldn't wear much more)
yeah (raspberry beret)

i think i... i think i... i think i love her

(raspberry beret)
no no no
no no no (the kind you find)
(in a second hand store)
(raspberry beret)

tell me
where have all the raspberry women gone? (and if it was warm she)
(wouldn't wear much more)
(raspberry beret)
i think i love...
