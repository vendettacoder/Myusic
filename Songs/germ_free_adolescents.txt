i know you're antiseptic, your deodorant smells nice
i'd like to get to know you, you're deep frozen like the ice 

she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
cleans her teeth ten times a day
scrub away, scrub away, scrub away the s.r. way 

you may get to touch her if your gloves are sterilized
rinse your mouth with listerine, blow disinfectant in her eyes 

she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
cleans her teeth ten times a day
scrub away, scrub away, scrub away the s.r. way

her phobia is infection, she needs one to survive 
it's her built-in protection, without fear she'd give up and die

she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
cleans her teeth ten times a day
scrub away, scrub away, scrub away the s.r. way 

she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
she's a germ free adolescent, cleanliness is her obsession
cleans her teeth ten times a day
scrub away, scrub away, scrub away the s.r. way
