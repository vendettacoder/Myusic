when they closed the last shopping mall
crickets sang in crumbling walls
termites ate through the doors
and rabbits hopped along the floors

the empty shelves swarmed with bees
cash machines sprouted weeds
lizards crawled the parking lot
swallows flew the empty shops

and there was peace in the valley once again

plants grew up the mannequins
painting them with leafy skin
clear plastic eyes fell to the floor
and were carried off by wild boars

all the mirrors cracked in half
when wild horses galloped past
and mourning doves built their nests
on the escalator steps

and there was peace in the valley once again
and there was peace in the valley once again
