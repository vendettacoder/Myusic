good golly, said little miss molly
when she was rockin' in the house of blue light
tutti frutti was oh so rooty
when she was rockin' to the east and west
lucille was oh so real
when she didn't do her daddy's will
come on baby, drive me crazy--do it, do it

i'm a speed king, you go to hear me sing
i'm a speed king, see me fly

saturday night and i just got paid
gonna fool about, ain't gonna save
some people gonna rock, some people gonna roll
gonna have a party to save my soul
hard headed woman and a soft hearted man
they been causing trouble since it all began
take a little rice, take a little beans
gonna rock and roll down to new orleans
