he feeds on fear
he feeds on pain
he rules again
with growing hate
he will gain
their faith again

no light in the darkness
is too small to see
there's always a sparkle of hope
if you just believe

he told the tale so many times
about the dream not meant to be
in a world of the free

plays with your mind

as faith for the future faded fast
he grows strong with their displeasure
it sets him free

deceiver of hearts
deceiver of fools
he rules with fear
deceiver of hopes
deceiver of fools
he rules again

he feeds on fear
poisons the truth
to gain their faith
to lead the way
to a world of decay

rules your heart

he'll sell your soul to the grave
without a hesitation to make
he belongs to the dark

deceiver of hearts
deceiver of fools
he rules with fear
deceiver of hopes
deceiver of fools
he rules again

please awake
and see the truth
he can only be
if you believe what he tells you
remember who you are
what you stand for
and there will always be a way

deceiver of hearts
deceiver of fools
he rules with fear
deceiver of hopes
deceiver of fools
he rules again

in my heart there is a place
in my heart there is a trace
of a small fire burning
a sheltering ray shines through this night
although it's small, it's bright
but darkness is lurking

he will sell your soul to bitterness and cold
oh fear him

deceiver of hearts
deceiver of fools
he rules with fear
deceiver of hopes
deceiver of fools
shall he rule again?
