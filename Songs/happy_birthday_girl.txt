"i hate this job 'cause i don't work with you.
i hate this mood that i'm in.
i hate the 'phone when it's not you.
i hate this time before i see you again.
i hate these people that are not you.
this photo that i've got of you.
i hate this empty room that you're not in.

happy birthday girl.
you know i cant be with you. of course i cant be with you, but i want to say. 
i'm happy with you. 
i'm happy without you. 
and i hope you are, a happy birthday girl.

i hate my body 'cause it's not near you.
i hate these clothes that keep me from your skin.
i hate the need to eat when i can't eat with you.
i hate these empty places that you've been.
i hate these buildings, roads and fields; the lonely, useless, empty space that just seperates me from you.

happy birthday girl. 
you know i can't be with you. 
of course i can't be with you.
but i hope you are a happy birthday girl.

lovers should be together,
and though we are apart.
you know i can't be with you.
of course i can't be with you.
lovers should be together
and it seems we are apart,
but i want to say;
i'm happy with you, unhappy without you.
i'm happy with you.
i'm happy with you.
unhappy without you.
