damn! look how muh-fuckers use a nigga 
just use me for whatever the fuck they want 
i don't get to say shit 
just grab me, just do what the fuck they want 
sell me, throw me away 
niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right? 
like i'm a f... i'm a gun, shit 
it's like i'm a motherfuckin gun 
i can't believe this shit.... 
word up.. (word up..) 

i seen some cold nights and bloody days, they grab me, bullets spray
they use me wrong so i sing this song 'til this day 
my body is cold steel for real 
i was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed 
under car seats they sneak me in clubs 
been in the hands of mad thugs 
they feed me when they load me with mad slugs 
seventeen precisely, one in my head 
they call me desert eagle, semi-auto with lead 
i'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns 
ohio to little rock to canarsie, living harshly 
beat up and battered, they pull me out 
i watch as niggaz scattered, making me kill 
but what i feel it never mattered 
when i'm empty i'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired 
a broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves 
under beds, so i beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred 
keep me full up with hollow heads 

chorus: nas (repeat 2x) 

how you like me now? i go blaow 
it's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul 
i might have took your first child, scarred your life, crippled your style 
i gave you power, i made you buck wild 

[nas] 
always i'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip 
the barrel is my dick, uncircumcised 
pull my skin back and cock me, i bust off when they unlock me 
results of what happens to niggaz shock me 
i see niggaz bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears 
fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years 
i've been used in robberies, giving niggaz heart to follow me 
placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause i was sprayed 
i was laid in a shelf, with a grenade 
met a wrecked-up teck with numbers on his chest that say 
five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero 
had a serial defaced, hoping one day, police would place 
where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him 
tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun 
but yo i had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on 
i make myself jam right in my owner's hand 

chorus 

[nas] 
yo, weeks went by and i'm surprised 
still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides 
besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a .9 
there's a grenade in a box, and that teck that kept crying 
cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear 
he's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career 
yo, i can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf 
his eyes bubbling, he said, "it was on" 
i felt his palm troubled him shaking
somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
he placed me on his waist, the moment i've been waiting
my creation was for blacks to kill blacks 
it's gats like me that accidentally, go off, making niggaz memories 
but this time, it's done intentionally 
he walked me outside, saw this cat, cocked me back, said, "remember me?" 
he pulled the trigger but i held on, it felt wrong 
knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for him 
he squeezed harder, i didn't budge, sick of the blood 
sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge 
what the other kid did was pull out, no doubt 
a newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase 
my owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast 
i didn't know he was hit, it's over with 
heard mad niggas screaming, niggaz running, cops is coming 
now i'm happy, until i felt somebody else grab me 
damn!
