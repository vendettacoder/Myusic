i am here, right here
where god puts none asunder
and you, in black dress and black shoe
you do invite me under

go on, go there
you can see me aging
stars turn, balls burn
coming kids are raging

death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun
death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun

(la la la)
(la la la)
(la la la)
(la la la)

every terrible thing is a relief
even months on end, buried in grief
are easy light times which have to end
with the coming of your death, friend

death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun
death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun

(la la la)
(la la la)
(la la la)
(la la la)

so strap me on and raise me high
cause buddy i'm not afraid to die
but life is long and it's tremendous
and we're glad that you're here with us
and since we know an end will come
it makes our living fun

death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun
death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun

(la la la)
(la la la)
(la la la)
(la la la)

death to me and death to you
tell me what else can we do die do
death to all and death to each
our own god-bottle s'within reach

death to everyone is gonna come
and it makes hosing much more fun
