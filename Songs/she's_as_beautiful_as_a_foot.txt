she's as beautiful as a foot
she's as beautiful as a foot
she heard somebody say, the other day

didn't believe it when he bit into her face
didn't believe it when he bit into her face
it tasted just like a fallen arch

she's as beautiful as a foot
she's as beautiful as a foot
she heard somebody say, the other day

don't put your tongue on the bloody tooth mark place
don't put your tongue on the bloody tooth mark place
her face changing now, a guernsey cow

she's as beautiful, oh so beautiful, beautiful as a foot
she heard someone say, the other day
