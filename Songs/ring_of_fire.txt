love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
i fell into a ring of fire

i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down as the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire, the ring of fire

the taste of love is sweet
when hearts like ours meet
i fell for you like a child
oh, but the fire went wild

i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down as the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire, the ring of fire

i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down as the flames went higher
and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire, the ring of fire

and it burns, burns, burns
the ring of fire, the ring of fire
the ring of fire, the ring of fire
