this is the first verse
this is the first verse
this is the first verse, the first, the first
and this is the first verse, verse, first verse
and this is the first verse, verse
this is the first verse

and this is the chorus
or perhaps it's a bridge
or just another part of the song that i'm singing

and this is the second verse
it could be the last verse
this is the second verse, second verse, second verse
it could be the last verse, last verse
and this is the second verse
but it's probably the last one

and this is the chorus
or perhaps it's a bridge
or just another key change
never mind, it doesn't hurt
it only means that i lost faith in this song
'cause it won't help me reach you...
