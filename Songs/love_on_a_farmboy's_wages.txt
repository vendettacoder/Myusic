high climbs the summer sun
high stands the corn
and tonight when my work is done
we will borrow your father's carriage
we will drink and prepare for marriage
soon, my darling, soon, my darling

shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in
shilling for the fellow who milks the herd
shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping
how can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?

deep under winter snow
deep lay the lambs
and tonight by the full moon's glow
flask of wine on my feather bedding
we will drink and prepare for wedding
soon, my darling, soon, my darling

shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in
shilling for the fellow who milks the herd
shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping
how can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?

people think that i'm no good
at painting pictures or carving wood
be a rich man if i could 
but the only job i do well is here on the farm
on the farm
and it's breaking my back

we will borrow your father's carriage
we will drink and prepare for marriage
soon, my darling, soon, my darling

shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in
shilling for the fellow who milks the herd
shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping
how can we feed

shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in
shilling for the fellow who milks the herd
shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping
how can we feed love on a farmboy's, love on a farmboy's, love on a farmboy's wages?
