white bolts of lightning
came out of nowhere
blinded the darkness
created the storm

war in the heavens
vengeance ignited
torment and tempest
attacks like a swarm

forged out of flame from chaos to destiny
bringer of pain, forever undying
judas is rising

eternal betrayer
ice cold and evil
taking no prisoners
dark prince of the world (dark prince of the world)

humanity trembles
enslaving you sinners
you can't beg for mercy
for none will be saved

the burden of sin echoes the prophecy
ascending from hell, forever despising
judas is rising

their faith is revealed, deceivers are crying
by crucified steel, evangelizing
judas is rising
judas is rising
