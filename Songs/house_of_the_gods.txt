finally found a place they could never reach
sipping singha beer on pattaya beach
singha beer don't ask no questions
singha beer don't tell no lies
singha beer don't ask no questions
singha beer don't tell no lies 

there's a guy next to me won't tell me his name
buy's me mekong whiskey just the same
singha beer don't ask no questions
singha beer don't tell no lies
singha beer don't ask no questions
singha beer don't tell no lies 

i'm just a wally
hanging out on pattaya beach
i'm just a wally
hanging out on pattaya beach 

met a girl said she's really going to blow my mind
she say's she don't mean sex and i say alright
turns out she's a bloke, tries to give me head
i have to run out screaming to the street instead
she's just a wally
hanging out on pattaya beach
i'm just a wally
hanging out on pattaya beach 

singha beer don't ask no questions
singha beer don't tell no lies...


in the house of the gods
where no mongrels preach
i watched the sun going down
on pattaya beach 

i'm just a wally
hanging out on pattaya beach
i'm just a wall
hanging out on pattaya beach
