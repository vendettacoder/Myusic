i can't get no satisfaction
i can't get me no satisfaction
and i try and i try and i try, t-t-t-try, try, try
i can't no, i can't get me no

when i'm riding in my car
and a man comes on the radio
he's tellin' me more and more
about some useless information
supposed to fire my imagination

i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say

i can't get no satisfaction
i can't get me no girl reaction
and i try and i try and i try, t-t-t-try, try, try
i can't no, i can't get me no

when i'm watchin' my tv
and a man comes on to tell me
how white my shirts could be
but he can't be a man 'cause he does not smoke
the same cigarettes as me

i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say

and when i'm flying 'round the world
and i'm doin' this and i'm tryin' to do that
and i'm trying to make some girl
who tells me
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
baby, baby
better come back later next week
can't you see i'm on a losing streak?

i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say

i can't get no (satisfaction)
i can't get me no (satisfaction)
i can't get no (satisfaction)
i can't get me no (satisfaction)
a-no, no, no, i can't get no (satisfaction)
a-no, no, no, i can't get me no (satisfaction)
a-no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (satisfaction)
a-n-n-n-n-n-n-no, no (satisfaction)
a-n-n-n-n-n-n-no, no (satisfaction)
a-n-n-no, i can't get me no (satisfaction)
well, i can't get no (satisfaction)
