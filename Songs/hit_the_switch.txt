i'm staring out into that vacuum again
from the back porch of my mind
the only thing that's alive
i'm all there is

and i start attacking my vodka, stab the ice with my straw
my eyes have turned red as stoplights, you seem ready to walk
you know i'll call you eventually, when i wanna talk
'til then you're invisible

'cause there's a switch that gets hit and it all stops making sense
and in the middle of drinks, maybe the fifth or the sixth
i'm completely alone at a table of friends
i feel nothing for them. i feel nothing, nothing

well, i need a break from the city again
i think i'll ship myself back west
i got a friend there, she says, "hey, any time."
unless that offers expired, i have been less than frequent
she's under no obligation to indulge every whim
and i'm so ungrateful, i take, she gives and forgives
and i keep forgetting it

and each morning she wakes with a dream to describe
something lovely that bloomed in her beautiful mind
i said "i'll trade you one for two nightmares of mine
i have some where i die, i have some where we all die."

i'm thinking of quitting drinking again
i know i said that a couple times
and i'm always changing my mind, well, i guess i am
but there's this burn in my stomach and there's this pain in my side
and when i kneel at the toilet
and the mornings clean light pours in through the window
sometimes i pray i don't die
i'm a goddamn hypocrite

but the night rolls around and it all starts making sense
there is no right way or wrong way, you just have to live
and so i do what i do and at least i exist
what could mean more than this?
what would mean more?
mean more?
