well, i dreamed i saw the knights in armor coming
saying something about a queen
there were peasants singing and drummers drumming
and the archer split the tree
there was a fanfare blowing to the sun
that was floating on the breeze
look at mother nature on the run
in the nineteen seventies
look at mother nature on the run
in the nineteen seventies

i was lying in a burned out basement
with the full moon in my eyes
i was hoping for replacement
when the sun burst through the sky
there was a band playing in my head
and i felt like getting high
i was thinking about what a friend had said
i was hoping it was a lie
thinking about what a friend had said
i was hoping it was a lie

well, i dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flying
in the yellow haze of the sun
there were children crying and colors flying
all around the chosen ones
all in a dream, all in a dream
the loading had begun
flying mother nature's silver seed 
to a new home in the sun
flying mother nature's silver seed 
to a new home
