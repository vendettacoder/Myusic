spit into the center of your hometown
there's leaves in the street
and there are friends around you now
all the days of your life in a line

or the way they seemed by '89
but it's not all right
it's not even close to all right

down a hall of your house, down a road in december
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
down a hall of your house, down a road in december
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)

we lie awake at night in a tent
and i say, "tell me about your uncle and his friend
'cause they seem like very bad men.
well, we want to keep away from them!"
(bend in the road back there
we saw the place they go)

"tell me about the greatest show
or the greatest movie you know
or the greatest song that you taped from off the radio.
you're going to play it again and again
it cuts off at the ending, though.

tell me i'm always going to be your best friend.
now, you said it one time, why don't you say it again?
all the way down the line to where the telephone ends
come on and shout it on down the wire.

and it's not all right
it's not even close to all right"

down a hall of your house, down a road in december
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
down a hall of your house, down a road in december
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)

and as the rescue party, the volunteer team
ah, they're just kids of eighteen
and it's the worst thing they've seen
and they're standing all around that tree
and i'm so sorry and i can't stop crying
oh, i know

shivering from the late fall cold
i felt like a solid ghost
i ran and then i couldn't slow
my father found me though
my father took me home

he said, "oh, son, i saw you get knocked down and i ran out
i bet your head was spinning.
with that bright pain you're stunned
when you've only just begun
to be only just beginning.

tossed in the viper pit
all those feelings and fears
and all the difficult shit
in all those tender years
there was something in the air
something gathered in the air
something singing in the wind

oh, i'll be your fighter and you'll be my mirror
and you'll be all right because i'll be right here
oh, kid, now i'm not going anywhere
i swear i'll try to not be going anywhere.

though it's not all right
it's so far from all right
we'll make it into a choice somehow
i don't know, but you'll have a choice somehow."

"down a hall in your house, down a road in december
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
we can never go back; we can only remember
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)

"maybe they told you about the summer sky
and maybe said there's a great gold spirit in the summer sky
all your friends, all your best, best friends
are going to gather around your bed at night
well that don't make it all right
because it is still so far from all right.
oh, kid, i know."

down a hall in your house, down a road in december
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
up the stairs, four flights up, can you feel my heart shiver?
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)

waking in the dawn with that dream getting dimmer and dimmer
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
i said, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down the deep river
oh, down the deep river
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)

down, down, down, down, down the deep river, down, down the deep river
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
why don't you, why don't you, oh, say you still see it
say, say you remember
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)

are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
hey, hey, hey
are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, down, down the deep river
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
i know it's scary, baby

(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
(down, down, down the deep river)
