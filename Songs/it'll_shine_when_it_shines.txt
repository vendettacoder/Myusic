the old cat on the roof.
he could stand a little push.
cause he's got nine good lives to live.

but like my mama said.
you only live till your dead.
and you got to give and give and give.

theres a pebble in a pond.
going on and on.
making waves and tides and ripples and rain.
theres a leaf in the wind.
that don't no where to end.
chasing days and waves and wishes and dreams

seems like everyone is out, looking for the sun.
singing rain and pain on he who hesitates.
but it'll shine when it shines.
you might think i'm wasting time.
but i'm just a good old boy that's learned to wait.

wipperwil's in the dawn.
pretty soon he'll be gone.
but he's got one good song to sing.
but like my daddy said.
it's in your heart not your head.
and you've got to sing and sing and sing.

theres a window in the wall.
looking out on it all.
leavin' fears and tears and troubles along.
theres a fire in the stove.
keeping out the cold.
warming wine and winters and babies and homes.

seems like everyone is out looking for the sun.
singing rain and pain on he who hesitates.
but it'll shine when it shines.
you might think i'm waisting time.
but i'm just a good old boy thats learned to wait.
yes i'm just a good old boy thats learned to wait.
