i still don't know what i was waiting for
and my time was running wild
a million dead-end streets and
every time i thought i'd got it made
it seemed the taste was not so sweet

so i turned myself to face me
but i've never caught a glimpse
of how the others must see the faker
i'm much too fast to take that test

ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
turn and face the strange
ch-ch-changes
don't want to be a richer man
ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
turn and face the strange
ch-ch-changes
just gonna have to be a different man
time may change me
but i can't trace time

ooh yeah

i watch the ripples change their size
but never leave the stream
of warm impermanence and
so the days float through my eyes
but still, the days seem the same

and these children that you spit on
as they try to change their worlds
are immune to your consultations
they're quite aware what they're going through

ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
turn and face the strange
ch-ch-changes
don't tell them to grow up and out of it
ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
turn and face the strange
ch-ch-changes
where's your shame?
you've left us up to our necks in it
time may change me
but you can't trace time

strange fascination, fascinating me
oh, changes are taking the pace i'm going through

ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
turn and face the strange
ch-ch-changes
oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
turn and face the strange
ch-ch-changes
pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
time may change me
but i can't trace time
i said that time may change me
but i can't trace time
