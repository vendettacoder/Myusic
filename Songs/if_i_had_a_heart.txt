this will never end 'cause i want more
more, give me more, give me more

this will never end 'cause i want more
more, give me more, give me more

if i had a heart i could love you
if i had a voice i would sing
after the night when i wake up
i'll see what tomorrow brings

ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
if i had a voice i would sing

dangling feet from window frame
will they ever ever reach the floor?
more, give me more, give me more

crushed and filled with all i found
underneath and inside just to come around
more, give me more, give me more

if i had a voice i would sing
