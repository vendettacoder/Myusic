she can burn you up in bed
just like she said
cos she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

she can throw uh pot t'show (?)
she can start a fire aglow
cos she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

she puts her head into the fire
makes you red hot perspire
cos she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

she was burnt before she was born
burnin' up a storm
cos she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

lick out like flame
'n' burn you to a shame
'n' bite the burnin' flame

things are burnin' big
she's a red hot pig
she's a hobo wire toaster
she's a circle on a spit

she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

she can stitch you to a wheel
take you to her fire
'n' spin you round 'n' round
boy, you take you down

fire fire fire

she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

burn you up in bed
just like she said
cos she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

she can lick out like a flame
burn you to a shame
yeah, bite a burnin' flame

she can burn you up in bed
coil you up instead
cos she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

she can throw uh pot t'show (?)
she can start a fire aglow
