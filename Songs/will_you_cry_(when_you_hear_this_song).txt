when you hear this song will you cry?
cuz you know you're wrong
will you cry?

love is pain and pain could pleasure 
if you would have only realized 
and now it's your turn to cry 
the camel's back broke tonight 
it's too late to try 

when you hear this song will you cry?
cuz you know you're wrong
will you cry?

tears roll down my cheeks and 
you were never around to wipe my eyes 
for years you played hide-and-seek 
with my love 
you are just that kind of guy 

when you hear this song will you cry?
cuz you know you're wrong
will you cry?
