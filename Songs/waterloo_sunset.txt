dirty old river, must you keep rolling, flowing into the night?
people so busy, make me feel dizzy, taxi light shines so bright
but i don't need no friends
as long as i gaze on waterloo sunset, i am in paradise

(sha-la-la) every day i look at the world from my window
(sha-la-la) but chilly, chilly is the evening time
waterloo sunset's fine (waterloo sunset's fine)

terry meets julie, waterloo station, every friday night
but i am so lazy, don't want to wander, i stay at home at night
but i don't feel afraid
as long as i gaze on waterloo sunset, i am in paradise

(sha-la-la) every day i look at the world from my window
(sha-la-la) but chilly, chilly is the evening time
waterloo sunset's fine (waterloo sunset's fine)

millions of people swarming like flies 'round waterloo underground
but terry and julie cross over the river where they feel safe and sound
and they don't, need no friends
as long as they gaze on waterloo sunset they are in paradise

waterloo sunset's fine
waterloo sunset's fine
waterloo sunset's fine
