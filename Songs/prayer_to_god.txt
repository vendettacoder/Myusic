to the one true god above, here is my prayer
not the first you've heard, but the first i wrote
not the first, but the others were a long time ago
there are two people here, and i want you to kill them

her, she can go quietly, by disease or a blow
to the base of her neck where her necklaces close
where her garments come together where i used to lay my face
that's where you oughta kill her in that particular place

him, just fucking kill him, i don't care if it hurts
yes i do, i want it to, fucking kill him but first
make him cry like a woman, no particular woman
let him hold out, hold back, someone or other might come

and fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him
kill him already, kill him
fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him
kill him already, kill him

fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him
kill him already, kill him
just fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him
fuckin' kill him already, kill him

ah fucking kill him, fuckin' kill him
kill him already, kill him
kill him already, kill him already
kill him, fuckin' kill him

just fuckin' kill him, fuckin' kill him
kill him already, kill him
fuckin' kill him, kill him
fuckin' kill him already, kill him

kill him, fucking kill him
kill him, just fucking kill him
kill him already, kill him already
kill him, amen
