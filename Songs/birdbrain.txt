i'm out, i'm out in bushes
playing, playing with plastics
birdbrain, they say i'm a birdbrain
if i am then can i just fly away

shoe straps and eyelashes washing my brain
twenty-five years are just washed down the drain

they are, they are a drunken bird
flying, into the windows
birdbrain, they say i'm a birdbrain
if i am then can i just fly away

shoe straps and eyelashes washing my brain
twenty-five years are just washed down the drain

shoe straps and eyelashes washing my brain
twenty-five years are just washed down the drain

if i am then can i just fly away
