people take pictures of the summer
just in case someone thought they had missed it
and to prove that it really existed

fathers take pictures of the mothers
and the sisters take pictures of brothers
just to show that they love one another

you can't picture love that you took from me
when we were young and the world was free
pictures of things as they used to be
don't show me no more, please

people take pictures of each other
just to prove that they really existed
just to prove that they really existed

people take pictures of each other
and the moment could last them for ever
of the time when they mattered to someone

people take pictures of the summer
just in case someone thought they had missed it
just to proved that it really existed

people take pictures of each other
and the moment to last them forever
of the time when they mattered to someone

picture of me when i was just three
sucking my thumb by the old oak tree
oh, how i love things as they used to be
don't show me no more, please
