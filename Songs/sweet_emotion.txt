sweet emotion
sweet emotion

you talk about things and nobody cares
you're wearin' out things that nobody wears
you're calling my name, but i gotta make clear
i can't say, baby, where i'll be in a year

some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
said, "my get up and go must have got up and went"
well, i got good news, she's a real good liar
'cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

sweet emotion
sweet emotion

i pulled into town in a police car
your daddy said i took it just a little too far
you're tellin' me things, but your girlfriend lied
you can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
a-yes, it did

you stand in the front just a-shakin' your ass
i'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
i talk about something you can sure understand
'cause a month on the road and i'll be eatin' from your hand
