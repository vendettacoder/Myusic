and it starts, sometime around midnight
or at least that's when you lose yourself
for a minute or two
as you stand, under the bar lights
and the band plays some song
about forgetting yourself for a while
and the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
and that white dress she's wearing
you haven't seen her for a while

but you know that she's watching
she's laughing, she's turning
she's holding her tonic like a cross
the room's suddenly spinning
she walks up and asks how you are
so you can smell her perfume
you can see her lying naked in your arms

and so there's a change, in your emotions
and all these memories come rushing
like feral waves to your mind
of the curl of your bodies
like two perfect circles entwined
and you feel hopeless and homeless
and lost in the haze of the wine

then she leaves, with someone you don't know
but she makes sure you saw her
she looks right at you and bolts
as she walks out the door
your blood boiling
your stomach in ropes
oh and when your friends say,
"what is it? you look like you've seen a ghost."

then you walk, under the streetlights
and you're too drunk to notice
that everyone is staring at you
you just don't care what you look like
the world is falling around you

you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you know that she'll break you in two
