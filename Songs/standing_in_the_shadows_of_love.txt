i'd run but there's no where to go
'cause heartaches will follow me i know
without your love, the love i need
it's the beginning of the end for me

'cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin' 
when you pushed aside all the love i've been giving
now wait a minute

didn't i teach you right, didn't i?
didn't i do the best i could, didn't i?
so don't you leave me

standin' in the shadow of love
i'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

all alone i'll desperately be
with misery my only company
come today, in fact come tomorrow

sorrow, i ain't got nothin' but sorrow
don't your conscience bother you
how can you watch me cry after all i've done for you
now hold a minute

gave you all the love i had, didn't i?
when you needed me i was there, now wasn't i?
(standing in the shadows of love
gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
i've tried not to cry out loud
no gal you ain't gonna help me now
what did i do to cause all this grief
now what'd i say to make you want to leave
now wait a minute
i gave my heart and soul to you, didn't i?
now didn't i always treat you good, didn't i?
i'm standing in the shadows of love
i'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
standing in the shadows of...
