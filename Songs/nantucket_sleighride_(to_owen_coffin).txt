goodbye, little robin-marie
don't try following me
don't cry, little robin-marie
'cause you know i'm coming home soon

my ships' leaving on a three-year tour
the next tide will take us from shore
windlaced, gather in sail and spray
on a search for the mighty sperm whale

fly your willow branches
wrap your body round my soul
lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
there are years behind us reaching
to the place where hearts are beating
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet



starbuck's sharpening his harpoon
the black man is playing his tune
an old salt's sleeping his watch away
he'll be drunk again before noon

three years sailing on bended knee
we found no whales in the sea
don't cry, little robin-marie
'cause we'll be in sight of land soon

fly your willow branches
wrap your body round my soul
lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
there are years behind us reaching
to the place where hearts are beating
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet
