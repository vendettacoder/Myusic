my baby said she wanted some action
i said baby, i can't give you that, i'm a simple man
my baby said she wanted adventure
i said baby, the outside world's unsafe, we should sit down

i read all the time about how they fly
like children my mind is filled with playtime
but why must i go out into the cold
my life is inside, we're safe we can hide
