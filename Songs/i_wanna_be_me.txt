turn the page and it's the scoop of the century
don't wanna be l7
i had enough of this
this is brainwash
and this is a clue
to the stars who fooled you
tell me why you can't explain
you're only looking for vinyl
yeah didn't they fool you
they wanna be you

gimme world war three
we can live again
you didn't fool me
i fooled you
you wanna be me
yeah you wanna be me
you wanna be someone
ruin someone
yeah didn't i fool you
i ruined you
yeah didn't i fool you
i sussed you out

i got you in the camera
and i got you in my camera
a second of your life
ruined for life
you wanna ruin me in your magazine
you wanna cover us in margerine
and now is the time
you got the time
to realise
to have real eyes

down, down, down, down
i'll take you down on the underground
down in the dark
and down in the crypt
down in the dark
where the typewriter fit
down, with your pen and pad
ready to kill
to make me ill

wanna be someone
need to be someone
you wanna be me
ruin me
a typewriter god
a black and white chief
pvc
blackboard books
black and white
you wanna be me
