suburbia, 1 am, you're walking home again
shopping bags and broken glass
i hate going through the underpass
i wish there was some other way around
but you got beaten up by the playground and it's no use
we'll have to go through the deserted shopping centre
pedestrian walkways i think they were meant to
make things better
but it's just emptier, and scary at nighttime.
hatfield at that time.

this is the place i live
where is everyone?  are we the only ones?
this is the place i live
and so does everyone, so does everyone.

hatfield 1980
i'm seeing my first knife, my first ambulance ride
i hold your hand the whole way, crying.
get home the next day, police have already been.
well you can imagine the scene.

and if i'm going home, i better change my clothes,
i better change my clothes.
and if i'm going home, i better change my clothes,
i better change my clothes.

this is the place i live
where is everyone, are we the only ones?
this is the place i live
and so does everyone, so does everyone.

and when i'm looking back, i look for everyone
and when i fall down, i fall for anyone
when i'm looking back, i look for everyone
and when i fall down, i fall for anyone.
