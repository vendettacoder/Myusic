(jimmie dale gilmore)

did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night
well dallas is a jewel, oh yeah dallas is a beautiful sight
and dallas is a jungle but dallas gives a beautiful light
did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night

well dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down
but when you are u, she's the kind you want to take around
but dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground
and dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down

(chorus)
well i came into dallas with the bright lights on my mind
but i came into dallas with a dollar and a dime

well dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye
a steel and concrete soul and a warm hearted love disguise
a rich man who tends to believe in his own lies
dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye

(chorus)

did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night
well dallas is a jewel, oh yeah dallas is a beautiful sight
and dallas is a jungle but dallas gives a beautiful light
did you ever see dallas from a dc-9 at night
