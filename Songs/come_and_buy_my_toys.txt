smiling girls and rosy boys 
come and buy my little toys 
monkeys made of gingerbread 
and sugar horses painted red 

rich men's children running past 
their fathers dressed in hose 
golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
gazing eyes and running wild 
past the stocks and over stiles 
kiss the window merry child 
but come and buy my toys 

you've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
the miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
leave the parsley on the stalls 
come and buy my toys 

you shall own a cambric shirt 
you shall work your father's land 
but now you shall play in the market square 
till you'll be a man 

smiling girls and rosy boys 
come and buy my little toys 
monkeys made of gingerbread 
and sugar horses painted red
