"to seek the sacred river alph
to walk the caves of ice
to break my fast on honey dew
and drink the milk of paradise..."

i had heard the whispered tales
of immortality
the deepest mystery
from an ancient book. i took a clue
i scaled the frozen mountain tops
of eastern lands unknown
time and man alone
searching for the lost - xanadu

xanadu -

to stand within the pleasure dome
decreed by kubla khan
to taste anew the fruits of life
the last immortal man
to find the sacred river alph
to walk the caves of ice
oh, i will dine on honey dew
and drink the milk of paradise

a thousand years have come and gone
but time has passed me by
stars stopped in the sky
frozen in an everlasting view
waiting for the world to end
weary of the night
praying for the light
prison of the lost - xanadu

xanadu -

held within the pleasure dome
decreed by kubla khan
to taste my bitter triumph
as a mad immortal man
nevermore shall i return
escape these caves of ice
for i have dined on honey dew
and drunk the milk of paradise
