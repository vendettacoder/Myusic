for all these years
i've been rushing and running away
i have seen the cities
the bars and the beaches are full
to keep away from you
i know i'll meet you
one day, for a lifetime
i'm scared
one thousand years i could live on your smile
i'm scared
and run away forever

for all that time i've been crazy
there is no escape
come back to the city
come back in the hotel and wait
the city waits forever
