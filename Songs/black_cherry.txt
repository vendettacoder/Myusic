how can it be?
i can taste you now
how can i see
when you're everything

all the world in one grain of sand
and i've blown it
all my world in one grain of sand
and you own it

black cherry
black cherry
stone

black cherry 
black cherry
stone

hearing you say it
i could die
trembling star
just reminds me

all the world in one grain of sand
and i've blown it
all my world in one grain of sand
and you own it

black cherry
black cherry
stone

black cherry 
black cherry
stone

excite me, ignite me
oh and you know,
i miss you, i kiss you
oh and you know

black cherry
black cherry
stone

black cherry 
black cherry
stone

excite me, ignite me
oh and you know,
i miss you, i kiss you
oh and you know
