i never knew the charm of spring
i never met it face to face
i never knew my heart could sing
i never missed a warm embrace

till april in paris, chestnuts in blossom
holiday tables under the trees
april in paris, this is a feeling
that no one can ever reprise

i never knew the charm of spring
i never met it face to face
i never knew my heart could sing
i never missed a warm embrace
till april in paris
whom can i run to
what have you done to my heart
