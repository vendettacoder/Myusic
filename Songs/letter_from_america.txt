when you go will you send back
a letter from america?
take a look up the railtrack
from miami to canada

broke off from my work the other day
i spent the evening thinking about
all the blood that flowed away
across the ocean to the second chance
i wonder how it got on when it reached the promised land?

when you go will you send back
a letter from america?
take a look up the railtrack
from miami to canada

i've looked at the ocean
tried hard to imagine
the way you felt the day you sailed
from wester ross to nova scotia
we should have held you
we should have told you
but you know our sense of timing
we always wait too long

when you go will you send back
a letter from america?
take a look up the railtrack
from miami to canada

lochaber no more
sutherland no more
lewis no more
skye no more
(3x)

i wonder my blood
will you ever return
to help us kick the life back
to a dying mutual friend
do we not love her?
i think we all claim we love her
do we have to roam the world
to prove how much it hurts?

when you go will you send back
a letter from america?
take a look up the railtrack
from miami to canada
