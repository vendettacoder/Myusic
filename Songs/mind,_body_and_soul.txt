westbound number nine
my eyes are closed but yet they see
the beauty of your love here surrounding me
though you're not here, you're not far away
and in my silence you can hear me say
i give my love to you all my body and soul
i give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old
give my love to you all my body and soul
give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old
you are my smiles the last tears
you are my days, my weeks, my years
you are the flowers beneath my window sill
you are everything beautiful everything that's real
i give my love to you all my body and soul
i give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old
one day my life it will be over, but i have no fears
cause nothing lasts but the years
but i love you now with every breath
and i believe i'll love you more after death
i give my love to you all my body and soul
i give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old
you are the winter, girl you are the spring
you are the bible, girl you are the ring
you are the lover you are the friend
you are the beginning, girl you are the end
i give my love to you all my body and soul
i give my mind to you with a love that'll never grow old
