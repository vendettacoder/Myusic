listen to the ground
there is movement all around
there is something goin' down
and i can feel it

on the waves of the air
there is dancin' out there
if it's something we can share
we can steal it

and that sweet city woman
she move through the light
controllin' my mind and my soul
when you reach out for me, girl
and the feelin' is right

i get that night fever, night fever
we know how to do it
gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to show it

here i am
prayin' for this moment to last
livin' on the music so fine
born on the wind
makin' it mine

night fever, night fever
we know how to do it
gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to show it

in the heat of our love
don't need no help for us to make it
gimme just enough
to take us to the mornin'

i got fire in my mind
i get higher in my walkin'
and i'm glowing in the dark
i give you warning

and that sweet city woman
she moves through the light
controllin' my mind and my soul
when you reach out for me, girl
and the feelin' is right

night fever, night fever
we know how to do it (feels like forever, baby, don't you know?)
gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to show it

here i am
prayin' for this moment to last
livin' on the music so fine
born on the wind
making it mine

night fever, night fever
we know how to do it (feels like forever, baby, don't you know?)
gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to show it (i'll leave you never, baby, don't you know?)

gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to do it (feels like forever, baby, don't you know?)
gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to show it (i'll leave you never, baby, don't you know?)

gimme that night fever, night fever
we know how to do it
