i need them for my headaches, i need them for skin.
we need it for a night out and sometimes for a night in.
the room stinks of poppers, the bog's full of bile.
at least i'm not shitting blood again.
i always sat it's worst in the while.

i hear we had a good time. 
i hear i was a riot.
i would've like me a lot last night, 
i could've put me to shame last night.

i feel out with a lover, i fell out with my friends.
i'm still trying to work out where the weekend ends.
no solids on sunday, we can eat in the week.
you said i was fucked - you got some fucking cheek

i hear we had a good time. 
i hear i was a right laugh.
i really loved you a lot last night. 
i could've hugged you to death last night.
