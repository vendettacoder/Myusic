there are those who think that life
has nothing left to chance,
a host of holy horrors
to direct our aimless dance

a planet of playthings
we dance on the strings
of powers we cannot perceive
"the stars aren't aligned -
or the gods are malign"
blame is better to give than receive.

you can choose a ready guide
in some celestial voice.
if you choose not to decide
you still have made a choice
you can choose from phantom fears
and kindness that can kill;
i will choose a path that's clear-
i will choose free will

there are those who think that
they've been dealt a losing hand,
the cards were stacked against them-
they weren't born in lotus-land

all pre-ordained
a prisoner in chains
a victim of venomous fate
kicked in the face
you can pray for a place
in heaven's unearthly estate

you can choose a ready guide
in some celestial voice.
if you choose not to decide
you still have made a choice
you can choose from phantom fears
and kindness that can kill;
i will choose a path that's clear-
i will choose free will

each of us
a cell of awareness
imperfect and incomplete
genetic blends
with uncertain ends
on a fortune hunt
that's far too fleet.

you can choose a ready guide
in some celestial voice.
if you choose not to decide
you still have made a choice
you can choose from phantom fears
and kindness that can kill;
i will choose a path that's clear-
i will choose free will
