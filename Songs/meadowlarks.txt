meadowlark, fly your way down
i hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
for you to wear upon your fleecy down
my meadowlark, sing to me

hummingbird, just let me dive
inside the broken ovals of your olive eyes
i do believe you gave it your best try
my hummingbird, sing to me

my hummingbird, sing to me

don't believe a word that i haven't heard
little children laughing at the boys and girls
the meadowlark singing to you each and every day
the arc light on the hillside and the market in the hay
