who gives a fuck about an oxford comma?
i've seen those english dramas too
they're cruel
so if there's any other way
to spell the word, it's fine with me
with me

why would you speak to me that way?
especially when i always said that i
haven't got the words for you
all your diction, dripping with disdain
through the pain, i always tell the truth

i climbed to dharamsala too
i did
i met the highest lama

to me

check your handbook, it's no trick
take the chapstick, put it on your lips
crack a smile, adjust my tie
know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

why would you lie about how much coke you have?
why would you lie about something dumb like that?
why would you lie about anything at all?
first the window, then it's to the wall
lil' jon, he always tells the truth

check your passport, it's no trick
take the chapstick, put it on your lips
crack a smile, adjust my tie
know your butler, unlike other guys

why would you lie about how much coke you have?
why would you lie about something dumb like that?
why would you lie about anything at all?
first the window, then it's to the wall
why would you tape my conversations?
show your paintings at the united nations
lil' jon, he always tells the truth
