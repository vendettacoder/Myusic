(now it's time for our wrap up
let's give it everything we've got
ready? begin)

artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing
analytically, i assault, animate things
broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
buildings are broken, basically i'm bombarding
casually create catastrophes, casualties
cancelling cats got their canopies collapsing
detonate a dime of dank daily doin dough
demonstrations, don dada on the down low
eatin other editors with each and every energetic
epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
furious fat fabulous fantastic
flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics
gift got great global goods gone glorious
gettin godly in his game with the goriest
hit em high, hella height, historical
hey holocaust hints hear 'em holler at your homeboy
imitators idolize, i intimidate
in a instant, i'll rise in a irate state
juiced on my jams like jheri curls jockin joints
justly, it's just me, writin my journals
kindly i'm kindling all kinds of ink on
karate kick type brits in my kingdom
let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
learned lame louses just lose to my livery
my mind makes marvelous moves, masses
marvel and move, many mock what i've mastered
niggas nap knowin i'm nice naturally
knack, never lack, make noise nationally
operation, opposition, off, not optional
out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
perfected poem, powerful punchlines
pummelling petty powder puffs in my prime
quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's quannum
quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh
really raw raps, risin up rapidly
riding the rushing radioactivity
super scientifical sound search sought
silencing stupefied saps that are soft
tales ten times talented, too tough
take that, challengers, get a tune up
universal, unique untouched
unadulterated, the raw uncut
verb vice lord victorious valid
violate vibes that are vain make em vanished
wow, well well, what a wise wordsmith just
weaving up words weeded up on my workshift
xerox, my x-ray-diation holes extra large
x-height letters, and xylophone tones
yellow back, yak mouth, young ones yaws
yesterday's lawn yardsale, i yawn
zig zag zombies, zoomin to the zenith
zero in zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme zea-lots!....

(good....can you say it faster?)
