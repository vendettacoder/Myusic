well you're my friend 
and can you see 
many times, we've been out drinking 
many times we've shared our thoughts 
but did you ever, ever notice
the kind of thoughts i got?

well you know i have a love
a love for everyone i know
and you know i have a drive
to live i won't let go
but can you see its opposition
comes rising up sometimes?
that its dreadful imposition
comes blacking in my mind?

and that i see a darkness 
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
did you know how much i love you?
here's a hope that somehow you
can save me from this darkness

well i hope that someday buddy
we have peace in our lives
together or apart
alone or with our wives
and we can stop our whoring
and pull the smiles inside
and light it up forever
and never go to sleep
my best unbeaten brother
this isn't all i see

oh no, i see a darkness
oh no, i see a darkness
oh no, i see a darkness
oh no, i see a darkness
did you know how much i love you?
here's a hope that somehow you
can save me from this darkness
