when i was ten i thought my brother was god - he'd lie in bed and turn out the 
light with a fishing rod. i learned the names of all his football team, aid i 
still remembered them when i was nineteen.
strange the things deal that i remember still - shouts from the playground when 
i was home and ill. my sister taught me all that she learned there; when we 
grow up, we said, we'd share a flat somewhere.
when i was seventeen, london meant oxford street.
where i grow up there were no factories. there was a school and shops and some 
fields and trees, and rows of houses one by one appeared. i was born in one and 
lived there for eighteen years.
then when i was nineteen. i thought the humber would be the gateway from my 
little world into the real world. but there is no real world - we live side by 
side, and sometimes collide. .
when i was seventeen, london meant oxford street. it was a little world; i grew 
up in a little world.
