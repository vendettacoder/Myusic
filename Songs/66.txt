you walked in
just like smoke
with a little c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
in your walk
come on

i've been waiting
are you waiting
for my move?
well, i'm making it

so tell me baby, can you shake it?
if i can move it with you
will you let me take it?
i'll be down on my knees
screaming, "take me, take me
take me, take me - i'm yours"

i've never felt so out of control
you don't even know
what you're doing to me
c'mon and do it to me
don't you stop

c'mon, c'mon
c'mon, little rabbit
show me where you've got it
'cos i know you've got a habit...

c'mon, c'mon...
show me
