i work hard everyday
come rain or shine
and i don't need no one
to tell me 'bout a girl of mine
she's got so much love
and she saves it all for me
i would not be lying
that's the way it's got to be

so mr. big
you'd better watch out
when only you hang around me
oh for you now
i will dig
a great big hole in the ground.

i don't care who you are
so don't explain
just get out of here
and don't come back again
i don't want a thing from you
i don't want to give you nothing too
get out of here
before i lose my cool.

mr. big
oh watch out
baby and don't you hang around me
oh for you now
i will dig
a great big hole in the ground.

so mr. big
you'd better watch out
when only you hang around me
oh for you now
i will dig
a great big hole in the ground
