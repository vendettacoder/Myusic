(dave swarbrick, mctell)
feel how the wind blows, december despair
bring me a ribbon to tie up my hair
i'll be your bride, go where you go
all of my life, you'll be my beau
chorus:
kiss me and i might
put on the white dress
if you'll take me dancing tonight
the night's in your face, sky's in your eyes
the day's in my arms when you're by my side
whenever you're weary i'll sing you a song
whenever you're lonely i'll show you you're wrong
chorus
come from the window, let's climb the stairs
all of my sorrows are none of your cares
while life is in us, let's love all we can
i'll be your woman if you'll be my man
chorus
