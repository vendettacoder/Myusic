i'm gonna be round my vegetables
i'm gonna chow down my vegetables
i love you most of all
my favorite vega-table

if you brought a big brown bag of them home
i'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

i'm gonna keep well my vegetables
cart off and sell my vegetables
i love you most of all
my favorite vega-table

i tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
i'm red as a beet 'cause i'm so embarassed

(mom and daddy says) sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)

oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do
oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do

i threw away my candy bar and i ate the wrapper (wink, wink)
and when they told me what i did i burst into laughter

(mom and daddy says) sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
