like most babies smell like butter
his smell smelled like no other
he was born scentless and senseless
he was born a scentless apprentice

away
go away, go away

every wet nurse refused to feed him
electrolytes smell like semen
i promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
there are countless formulas for pressing flowers

away
go away, go away

i lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
leaking the gas we'll make into perfume
you can't fire me because i quit!
throw me in the fire and i won't throw a fit

hey, go away
go away, go away
go away, go away
go away, go away
