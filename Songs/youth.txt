youth has gone
i heard you say
it doesn't matter
anyway
don't hide the photos
or turn off the lights
i'm quite sure we've both seen
funnier sights

you
sleep in a deep deep sleep
beauty is skin deep

youth has gone
though we're still young
it's hard i know to believe
that i was somebody's son
the memories
of what you once were
the memories of what
we both were

you
sleep in a deep deep sleep
beauty is skin deep

youth has gone
and don't think i don't cry
we let ourselves slip
and now
i ask myself why
i'm on my own
and don't think i really mind
when after all
the years have been fairly kind

you
sleep in a deep deep sleep
beauty is skin deep
sleep in a deep deep sleep
beauty is skin deep

youth...youth...youth...sleep
