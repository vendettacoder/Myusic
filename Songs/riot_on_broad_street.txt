my father once told this to me
boston's gritty history
another ruthless battle
in a useless holy war
handed down discrepancies
and tensions that'll never ease
one early afternoon on broad street
it blew up down there for sure

broad street's just not broad enough
and you just don't love god enough
and if that isn't odd enough
we've taken too much crap
you've pushed us round the sod enough
we'e scrapped and rapped and jawed enough
poked, provoked and prod enough
something's gonna snap

the boston fire fighting volunteers
on their way to fight a fire somewhere
met with a funeral procession
proceeding way too slow
a brownstone burns out of control
we need to lay to rest this soul
loggerheads on broadstreet
eye to eye and toe to toe

broad street's just not broad enough
and you just don't love god enough
and if that isn't odd enough
we've taken too much crap
you've pushed us round the sod enough
we'e scrapped and rapped and jawed enough
poked, provoked and prod enough
something's gonna snap

riot down on broad street
hand me a brick, a stick, a picket
bottle, axe or cobblestone
riot down on broad street
and if i'm going down
hell, i'm not going down alone
i won't go down alone

and when the fight was over
they retired to the clover,
silver dollar, thirsty scollar
whatever pubs they had back then
the brownstone was in ashes
broken bones and bloody gashes
and a casket sat on broad street 
'til the sun came up again

broad street's just not broad enough
and you just don't love god enough
and if that isn't odd enough
we've taken too much crap
you've pushed us round the sod enough
we'e scrapped and rapped and jawed enough
poked, provoked and prod enough
something's gonna snap

riot down on broad street
hand me a brick, a stick, a picket
bottle, axe or cobblestone
riot down on broad street
and if i'm going down
hell, i'm not going down alone
and if i'm going down
hell, i'm not going down alone
and if i'm going down
hell, i'm not going down alone

there's a riot down on broad street (x 4)
