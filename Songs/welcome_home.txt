i'm so alone, my love without you
you're part of everything i do
when you come back, and you're beside me
these are the words i'll say to you

welcome home, welcome
come on in, and close the door
you've been gone, too long
welcome, you're home once more

i thought of all the things i'd say to you
when you come back to me someday
when you are here and we're together
with all my heart you'll hear me say

welcome home, welcome
come on in, and close the door
you've been gone, too long
welcome, you're home once more

there are so many lonely people
why must they ever be apart
i hope someday you'll be together
singing these words with all your heart

welcome home, welcome
come on in, and close the door
you've been gone, too long
welcome, you're home once more
(welcome home)
