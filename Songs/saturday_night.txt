s-s-s-suddenly there's a knock at your head
don't let them in because they're trying to take your tv set
h-h-h-happiness is the ball in your hand
you've got to try and throw this party just as far as you can

c-c-c-creosote is pouring out of my brain
i swear i heard the floorboards, they were creaking your name
g-g-g-get a room, get ahead, get a hat
we're going to hell anyway, let's travel first class

come through the city on a saturday night
watching the boys on their motorbikes
i wanna be like those guys
i wanna wear my clothes tight
with matching jackets and a fistful of notes
new sneakers and a fresh pack of smokes

p-p-p-pneumothorax is a word that is long
they're just trying to put some punk back into punctured lung
p-p-p-panic over, party off, party on
cause we are birds of a feather and you can be the fat one

come through the city on a saturday night
over your heads like a satellite
i wanna see what they see
i wanna love you like crazy
'cause cameras are pointing right at your face
can see into your room from outer space

come through the city on a saturday night
it's not the size of the man in the fight
i wanna know what that does
i wanna show what matters
'cause it's the size of the fight in the man
that makes the difference and decides who is champ

come through the city on a saturday night
'cause you and me we're on the edge of the knife

come through the city on a saturday night
i asked your mother and she said it's all right
we're getting married when we're thirty
i wanna do it on your birthday
'cause i don't wanna waste a moment with you
i just wanna dance the whole night through

come through the city on a saturday night
'cause you and me we're on the edge of the knife
