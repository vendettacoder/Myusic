just because they seem to understand the way you feel 
it just doesn't mean that they'll feel the same way too 
just because they seem to hold a mirror to your life 
it just doesn't follow that they'll be just like you

take no heroes, it's no good
they don't stand up to you 
just take the bits you think that you can use

i remember when i was younger 
i thought the answers were locked in people 
so i admired the ones whose lives were 
a source of envy to people like me 

but do you really want to meet 
the ones who write your dreams 
believe me, it's a fantasy 
you won't like the reality 

if you want heroes keep them safe 
they don't stand up to life so
lock them in your soul and lose the key 

i love you, i don't wanna meet you x12

when i see you it makes me feel 
there's someone else out there like me 
you touch my soul with what you do 
it all makes sense when i hear you 
you understand the way i feel 
i know exactly what you mean 
it's like i've known you all my life 
i think of you i feel alright 

but in the flesh how would it be 
if you could really see 
the weaknesses you never knew 
alive and staring back at you 

if you want heroes keep them safe 
they don't stand up to life so 
lock them in your soul and lose the key 
lock them in your soul and lose the key 
lock them in your soul and lose the key
