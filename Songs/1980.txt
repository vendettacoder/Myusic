they say that everything you go through in life
that's what you become
if that's the case yeah
i'm becoming number one
listen
it's estelle
yo yo

i grew up in the 1980s
in a four-bedroom house
my family, my grandma, three or four aunties
uncles and brothers -- in and out of prison daily
certain times when there was no heat -- we stay under covers
there was life like you never seen
daddy taking extra people in 
come dinner time, it was tipping eighteen
boiling a big pot of water on the stove to take a bath
rub my face in olive oil, all my mates used to laugh
now cousins moved out, and we all got divided
started to get older; i seen god providing
i've seen fifty pound last for three months solid
i got my first pair of nike's -- we were still eating porridge
me and my cousin used to play "mel &amp; kim" -- practising dancing
coming down the stairs and ting
i touched africa and came back darker
knowing myself
feeling my roots a little bit harder

(chorus)
1980 year that god made me
'89 i started to get mine
'99 i started to write rhymes
come walk with me reminisce on my life

1980 year that god made me
'89 i started to get mine
'99 i started to write rhymes
come walk with me reminisce on my life

so then we moved up
thought i was the 'fresh prince'
'dynasty' was re-runs and 'dallas' was faded
with three beds this time and six kids still
we got a doggie -- yes that dog loved to shit, but
my brother got his first pair of la gears
he thought it was to take pictures of, instead of wear (what?)
we started hanging out my jeans got tighter
my weird neighbours set their own house on fire
church was all day every day and every week
that's where i learnt how to sing -- hearing that pastor preach
benidiction was all we went for
so we could run home and play 'connect 4'
mum worked late and we learnt to cook
sasparilla and stew pea soup
in the room watching kung-fu films and 'cleopatra jones'
wishing we was 'cosby kids' and the matchstick girls

(chorus)
1980 year that god made me
'89 i started to get mine
'99 i started to write rhymes
come walk with me reminisce on my life

1980 year that god made me
'89 i started to get mine
'99 i started to write rhymes
come walk with me reminisce on my life

the man downstairs was dead for three weeks
his own cat started eating him, the house starts to wreak
that's when we moved out and our house was bigger
we had a large garage and the attic was killer
we used to pray for three hours in the morning
sitting on the school bus, believe we was yawning
all our hair was stuck down to our foreheads
jam and splits, dorags and pin curls, yes
sexy boys walking round showing interest 
in what, i don't know, cause we all had flat chests
don't think we never mastered the 'kid-n-play' steps
doowap for days in the bogle, yep
but this is just the beginning of my life, right
nine kids; a house; and one lifetime
yo, the beginning of my life, right
nine kids; a house; and one lifetime

(chorus)
1980 year that god made me
'89 i started to get mine
'99 i started to write rhymes
come walk with me reminisce on my life

1980 year that god made me
'89 i started to get mine
'99 i started to write rhymes
come walk with me reminisce on my life

it's my... it's my my lifetime...
