the childhood part of my life
wasn't very pretty, see...
boom, boom-boom, boom
i was born and raised
in the slums of the city,
boom, boom-boom, boom
it was a one-room shack
that slept ten other children beside me,
boom, boom-boom, boom
we hardly enough food
or room to sleep
boom, boom-boom, boom
it was hard times...
i needed somethin' to ease my troubled mind

oooh listen...
my father didn't know the meaning of work
boom, boom-boom, boom
he disrespected mama,
and treated us like dirt
boom, boom-boom, boom
i left home seeking a job
that i never did find
boom, boom-boom, boom
depressed and down-hearted
and i took to cloud nine
boom, boom-boom, boom

i'm doing fine
up here, on cloud nine
listen,  one more time
i'm doing fine
up here, on cloud nine
folks down there tell me...

they say give yourself a chance,son,
don't let life pass you by,
woo, woo, woo-oo
but the world, around you's, is a rat race
where only the strongest survive,
it's a dog-eat-dog world
and that ain't no lie,
ain't no lie
dennis: listen it ain't even safe no more
to walk the streets at night

i'm doing fine
on cloud nine

let me tell you 'bout cloud nine...
cloud nine
you can be what you want to be
cloud nine
you ain't got no responsibility
cloud nine
and every man, every man is free
cloud nine
you're a million miles from reality
reality

i wanna' stay up
higher
up up, up and away

cloud nine

i wanna' say i love the life i live,
and i'm going to 
live, the life i love
or be on cloud nine...
i, i, i, i, i, i'm ridin' high
on cloud nine

you're as free as a bird in flight
cloud nine
there's no difference between day and night
cloud nine
it's a world of love and harmony
cloud nine
you're a million miles from reality
reality

i wanna' stay up
higher
up up, up and away

cloud nine
you can be what you want to be, ah
cloud nine
you ain't got no responsibility
cloud nine
every man in his mind is free
cloud nine
you're a million miles from reality
cloud nine
you can be what you want to be
