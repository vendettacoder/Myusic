i know what you want - the magpies have come;
if you know me so well, then tell me which hand i use...

make them go...
make it go...

saw her there... restaurant -  poppy, don't go...
i know your mother is a good one, but poppy, don't go;
i'll take you home...

show me the things i've been missin'...
show me the ways i forgot to be speaking...
show me the ways to get back to the garden...

show me the ways to get around the get-around;
show me the ways to button up 
buttons that have forgotten they're buttons;
well, we can't have that forgetting that...

girls... girls...
what have we done? what have we done to ourselves? yes...

driving on the vine, over clothes lines,
but officer, i saw the sign..

thought i'd been through this in 1919:
counting the tears of ten thousand men,
and gathered them all, but my feet are slipping...

there's something we left on the windowsill;
there's something we left, yes...

we'll see how brave you are;
we'll see how fast you'll be running...
we'll see how brave you are;
yes, anastasia...

and all your dollies have friends...

thought she deserved no less than she'd give...
well, happy birthday, her blood's on my hands;
it's kind of a shame, 'cause i did like that dress...

it's funny the things that you find in the rain;
the things that you find... yes...

in the mall, and in the date-mines;
in the knots still in her hair...
on the bus, i'm on the way down... on the way down;
all the girls seem to be there...

we'll see how brave you are - oh, yes;
we'll see how fast you'll be running...
we'll see how brave you are...
we'll see...

we'll see how brave you are - oh, yes;
we'll see how fast you'll be running...
we'll see how brave you are...
yes, anastasia...

come along now, little darlin';
come along now, with me...
come along now, little darlin';
we'll see how brave you are.
