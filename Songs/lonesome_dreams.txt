i land on an island coast
where the only souls i see are ghosts
i run through wooded isle
and chase the sunlight mile after mile

and i feel like i know this place
as a tree line breaks in a wide open space
i stare at a bright red sun
and search all day, never find anyone

i walk on a winding road
in the deep of the night near the edge of the knoll
i pass by a moonlit lake
and a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake

and i feel i should know this place
as a road winds on in a wide open space
the wind plays a haunting tune
as i make my way through the night all alone

i been dreaming again of a lonesome road
where i'm lost and i've got no friends
just the rocks and the trees
and my lonesome dreams
and a road that'll never end

i been dreaming again of a lonesome world
where i'm lost and i'm on my own
left my best in the beats on this trip, baby
just please don't leave me alone

i lie under starlit sky
and the seasons change in the blink of an eye
i watch as the planets turn
and the old stars die and the young stars burn

but i don't really know this place
and it's lonesome here in a wide open space
can it be as real as it seems
maybe this time i won't wake from the dream

i been dreaming again of a lonesome road
where i'm lost and i've got no friends
just the rocks and the trees
and my lonesome dreams
and a road that'll never end

i been dreaming again of a lonesome world
where i'm lost and i'm on my own
left my best in the beats on this trip, baby
just please don't leave me alone
