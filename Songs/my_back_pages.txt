crimson flames tied through my years
flowing high and mighty trapped
countless fire and flaming roads
using ideas as my maps

"we'll meet on edges soon", said i
proud 'neath heated brow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now

half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"rip down all hate", i screamed
lies that life is black and white
spoke from my skull, i dreamed

romantic flanks of musketeers
foundationed deep, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now

in a soldier's stance i aimed my hand
at the mongrel dogs who teach
fearing not i'd become my enemy
in the instant that i preach

sisters fled by confusion boats
mutiny from stern to bow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now

ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now

my guard stood hard when abstract threats
too noble to neglect
deceived me into thinking
i had something to protect

good and bad, i define these terms
quite clear, no doubt, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
