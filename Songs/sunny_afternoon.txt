the taxman's taken all my dough
and left me in my stately home
lazin' on a sunny afternoon
and i can't sail my yacht
he's taken everything i got
all i've got's this sunny afternoon

save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
i've got a big fat mama tryin' ta break me
and i love to live so pleasantly
live this life of luxury
lazin' on a sunny afternoon
in da summertime
in da summertime
in da summertime

my girlfriend's run off with my car
and gone back to her ma and pa
tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
now i'm sittin' here
sippin' at my ice cold beer
lazin' on a sunny afternoon

help me, help me, help me sail away
well, give me two good reasons why i oughta stay
'cause i love to live so pleasantly
live this life of luxury
lazin' on a sunny afternoon
in da summertime
in da summertime
in da summertime

ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
i got a big fat mama tryin' to break me
and i love to live so pleasantly
live this life of luxury
lazin' on a sunny afternoon
in da summertime
in da summertime
in da summertime
in da summertime
in da summertime
