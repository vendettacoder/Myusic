drop your silver in my tambourine
help a poor man fill a pretty dream
give me pennies, i'll take anything
now listen while i play
my green tambourine

watch the jingle jangle start to shine
reflections of the music that is mine
when you toss a coin, you'll hear it sing
now listen while i play
my green tambourine

drop a dime before i walk away
any song you want, i'll gladly play
money feeds my music machine
now listen while i play
my green tambourine

listen and i'll play
