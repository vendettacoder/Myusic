blind date with the chancer, we had oysters and dry lancers
and the check, when it arrived, we went dutch, dutch, dutch, dutch
a redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash
and this emery board is giving me a rash

i'm flat out
you're so beautiful to look at when you cry
freeze, don't move
you've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life

a shady lane, everybody wants one, a shady lane, everybody needs one
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god
the worlds collide, but all that we want is a shady lane

glance, don't stare
soon you're being told to recognize your heirs
no, not me
i'm an island of such great complexity

distress surrounds
in the muddy peaceful center of this town
tell me off
in the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the over-friendly concierge

a shady lane, everybody wants one, a shady lane, everybody needs one
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god
the worlds collide, but all that i want is a shady lane
