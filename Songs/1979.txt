shakedown 1979
cool kids never have the time
on a live wire right up off the street
you and i should meet

junebug skipping like a stone
with the headlights pointed at the dawn
we were sure we'd never see an end
to it all

and i don't even care to shake these zipper blues
and we don't know just where our bones will rest
to dust, i guess
forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

double cross the vacant and the bored
they're not sure just what we have in store
morphine city slippin' dues
down to see

that we don't even care, as restless as we are
we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
and poured cement
lamented and assured to the lights

and towns below
faster than the speed of sound
faster than we thought we'd go
beneath the sound of hope

justine never knew the rules
hung down with the freaks and ghouls
no apologies ever need be made
i know you better than you fake it to see

that we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
and we don't know just where our bones will rest
to dust, i guess
forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

the street heats the urgency of now
as you see, there's no one around
