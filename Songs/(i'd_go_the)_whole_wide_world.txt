when i was a young boy
my mama said to me
there's only one girl in the world for you
and she probably lives in tahiti

i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world just to find her

or maybe she's in the bahamas
where the caribbean sea is blue
weeping in a tropical moonlit night
because nobody's told her 'bout you

i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world just to find her
i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world just to find her

why am i hanging around in the rain out here
trying to pick up a girl
why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
when there's girls all over the world

well is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
underneath the tropical sun
pining away in a heatwave there
hoping that i won't be long

i should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
caressing her warm brown skin
and then in a year or maybe not quite
we'll be sharing the same next of kin

i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world just to find her
i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world just to find her
i'd go the whole wide world
i'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
yeah!
