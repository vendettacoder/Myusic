she was black as the night
louie was whiter than white
danger, danger when you taste brown sugar
louie fell in love over night
hey man, what's wrong with that?
nothing bad, it was good
louie had the best girl he could
when she took him home to meet her mama and papa
louie knew just where he stood

louie louie louie, louie louie louie
louie louie louie, louie you're gonna cry

all right, what's all this about?
i love her, man
oh yeah, man, let me tell you
i don't want no honky in my family, you dig?
no honky in my family

see what i mean
louie really caused a scene
he did, i tell you
ain't no diff'rence 'tween black or white
brothers, you know what i mean

louie louie louie, louie louie louie
louie louie louie, louie you're gonna cry

there he stood in the night
knowing what's wrong from what's right
he took her home to his mama and papa
louie had a terrible fright

what's goin' on?
well, we're in love
now listen, let me tell you
i don't want no spook in my family
get it, no spook in my family

see what i mean
louie really caused a scene
he did, i tell you
ain't no diff'rence 'tween black or white
brothers, you know what i mean

louie louie louie...
