junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
they're out of season
betrayal without treason

junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
there is one reason
why your mother was a seamstress

chaim soutine
never spent a thrift shop dime
in his life

lenny bruce
never walked in a dead man's shoes
even for one night

junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
no summer pavilion
no shooting season

junk shop clothes will get you...
for the rest of your life
you'll be drunk the rest of your life

and the sun
never shone
on your frame
pale and wan

junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
no summer pavilion
no shooting season

junk shop clothes will get you...
for the rest of your life
you'll be drunk the rest of your life

and the sun
never shone
on your frame
pale and wan
