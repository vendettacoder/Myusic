fall is here, hear the yell
back to school, ring the bell
brand new shoes, walking blues
climb the fence, books and pens
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
i can tell that we are gonna be friends

walk with me, suzy lee
through the park and by the tree
we will rest upon the ground
and look at all the bugs we've found
safely walk to school without a sound
safely walk to school without a sound

here we are, no one else
we walk to school all by ourselves
there's dirt on our uniforms
from chasing all the ants and worms
we clean up and now it's time to learn
we clean up and now it's time to learn

numbers, letters, learn to spell
nouns and books and show and tell
at playtime we will throw the ball
back to class, through the hall
teacher marks our height against the wall
teacher marks our height against the wall

we don't notice any time pass
we don't notice anything
we sit side-by-side in every class
teacher thinks that i sound funny
but she likes the way you sing

tonight i'll dream while i'm in bed
when silly thoughts go through my head
'bout the bugs and alphabet
and when i wake tomorrow, i'll bet
that you and i will walk together again
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
yes, i can tell that we are gonna be friends
