jenny said when she was just five years old
there was nothing happening at all
every time she puts on the radio
there was nothing going down at all, not at all

then one fine morning, she puts on a new york station
you know, she don't believe what she heard at all
she started shaking to that fine, fine music
you know, her life was saved by rock and roll

despite all the amputations
you know, you could just go out and dance to the rock and roll station
and it was all right (it was all right)
hey, baby, you know, it was all right (it was all right)

jenny said when she was just about 5 years old
"you know, my parents are gonna be the death of us all
two tv sets and two cadillac cars
well, you know, ain't gonna help me at all, not just a tiny bit"

then one fine morning, she turns on a new york station
she doesn't believe what she hears at all
ooh, she started dancing to that fine, fine music
you know, her life was saved by rock and roll, yeah, rock and roll

despite all the computations
you could just change it to that rock and roll station
and baby, it was all right (it was all right)
hey, it was all right (it was all right)
hey, here she comes now
