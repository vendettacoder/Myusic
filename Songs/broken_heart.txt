though i have a broken heart
i'm too busy to be heartbroken
there's a lot of things that need to be done
lord i have a broken heart

though i have a broken dream
i'm too busy to be dreaming of you
there's a lot of things that i gotta do
lord i have a broken dream


and i'm wasted all the time
i've gotta drink you right off of my mind
i've been told that this will heal given time
lord i have a broken heart

and i'm crying all the time
i have to keep it covered up with a smile
and i'll keep on moving on for a while
lord i have a broken heart
