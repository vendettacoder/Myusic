i'm going down to the place tonight
to see if i can get a taste tonight
a taste of something warm and sweet
that shivers your bones and rises to your heat

i'm going down to the place tonight
the damp and hungry place tonight
should all the stars shine in the sky
they couldn't outshine your sparkling eyes

but it's so hard to be the one
to touch and tease and to do it all for fun
but it's too much for a young heart to take
cause hearts are the easiest things you could break

and i talk to the filth, and i walk to the door
i'm knee deep in myself
but i want to get more of that stuff
of that stuff

some candy talking
some candy talking
talk

and i want
and i want
some candy talking
some candy talking
some candy talking
some candy talking

some candy talk
some candy talk
some candy talk
some candy talk

i love the way she's walking
i love the way she's talking
it's just the way she's walking
it's just the way she's talking

and i need
all that stuff
give me some
of that stuff
i want your candy
i want your candy

and i need
give me some
of your stuff
give me some
i want your candy 
i want your candy
i want your candy
i want your candy
i want stuff
