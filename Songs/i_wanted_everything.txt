i heard about the easter bunny presents under a christmas tree
it was dreaming and fantasy there was no mom or daddy
i wanted everything i wanted everything i wanted everything

i had the world on my shoulder but i was getting older
knew i was ready for it some kind of employment
i wanted everything i wanted everything i wanted everything

all day working on a truck bringing the groceries up
not much of a salary no tip for the delivery
i wanted everything i wanted everything i wanted everything

there's no success for me involved in a robbery
there's money in the supermarket and i'm goin' in after it
i wanted everything
