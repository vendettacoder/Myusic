secret heart
what are you made of?
what are you so afraid of?
could it be
three simple words?
or the fear of being overheard?
what's wrong?
let him in on your secret heart

secret heart
why so mysterious?
why so sacred, why so serious?
maybe you're just acting tough?
maybe you're just not man enough?
what's wrong?
let him in on your secret heart

this very secret
that you're trying to conceal
is the very same one
that you're dying to reveal
go tell him how you feel

secret heart
come out and share it
this loneliness
few can bear it
could it have
something to do with
admitting that you just can't go through it alone?
let him in on your secret heart

this very secret
that you're trying to conceal
is the very same one
that you're dying to reveal
go tell him how you feel
this very secret heart

go out and share it
this very secret heart
