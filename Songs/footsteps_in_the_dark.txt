are we really sure,
that a love that lasted for so long,
still endures?
do i, really care?
hey hey, 
let's talk about the distractions going on elsewhere

i, keep hearing footsteps baby
in the dark, oh in the dark
why? i keep hearing footsteps baby
in the dark
oh in the dark, hoo

my mind, 
just now and then,
looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
something's up ahead, 
hey, should i keep this same direction,
or go back instead?

i, keep hearing footsteps baby
in the dark, oh in the dark
why? i keep hearing footsteps baby
in the dark
oh in the dark, hoo

honey let's stop walking around
when there's love lost to be found
aah, you know i still care, i still care
what's the sense in going elsewhere?

who feels, really sure?
can i really guarantee your happiness shall endure?
do we, really care?
hey hey,
let's look at what's been happening and try to be more aware

i, keep hearing footsteps baby
in the dark, oh in the dark
why? i keep hearing footsteps baby
in the dark
oh in the dark, hoo

let's stop walking around
well when there's love, lost to be found
oh baby, you know, i still care, i still care
what's the sense in going elsewhere?

let's stop walking around
well when there's love, lost to be found
oh baby, you know, i still care, i still care
what's the sense in going elsewhere?
