she doesn't have to go to work
but she doesn't want to stay in bed
'cause it's changed from something comfortable
to something else instead

the bed has seen it all
from the first time to the last
the silences of now
and the good times of the past
and it only cost ten pounds
from a shop just down the road
mind you, that was seven years ago
and things where very different then.

it didn't get much rest at first
the headboard banging in the night
the neighbours didn't dare complain
oh everything was going right
now there's no need to complain
'cause it never makes a sound
something beautiful left town
and she doesn't even know its name

now every night she plays a sad game
called pretending nothing's going wrong

oh but she knows
if this show was televised
no one would watch it, not tonight
but seven years ago
la la la la la la la ...

now there's no need to complain
'cause it never makes a sound
something beautiful left town
and she never even knew its name

she doesn't have to go to work
but she doesn't want to stay in bed
'cause it's changed from something comfortable
to something else instead
