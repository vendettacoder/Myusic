well, i got us on a highway, i got us in a car
got us going faster than we've ever gone before
i got us on a highway, i got us in a car
got us going faster than we've ever gone before

and i know it ain't gonna last
and i know it ain't gonna last
when i see your eyes arrive
they explode like two bugs on glass

far above the ocean, deep under the sea
there's a river running dry 'cause of you and me
far above the ocean, deep under the sea
there's a river running dry 'cause of you and me

and i know it ain't gonna last
and i know it ain't gonna last
when i see your eyes arrive
they explode like two bugs on glass

she's a goddess on a highway, a goddess in a car
a goddess going faster than she's ever gone before
she's a goddess on a highway, a goddess in a car
goddess going faster than she's ever gone before

and i know it ain't gonna last
and i know it ain't gonna last

and i know it ain't gonna last
and i know it ain't gonna last
and i know it ain't gonna last
and i know it ain't gonna last
it ain't gonna last
it ain't gonna last
it ain't gonna last
it ain't gonna last
