please allow me to introduce myself: i'm a man of wealth and taste
i've been around for a long, long year; stole many man's soul and faith
i was 'round when jesus christ had his moment of doubt and pain
made damn sure that pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name
but what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

stuck around st. petersburg when i saw it was a time for a change
killed the czar and his ministers; anastasia screamed in vain
i rode a tank, held a general's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name, oh yeah
ah, what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

i watched with glee while your kings and queens
fought for ten decades for the gods they made
i shouted out "who killed the kennedys?"
when after all, it was you and me
let me please introduce myself: i'm a man of wealth and taste
and i laid traps for troubadours who get killed before they reach bombay

pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name, oh yeah
but what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
get down, baby

pleased to meet you -- hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
but what's confusing you is just the nature of my game

just as every cop is a criminal
and all the sinners saints
as heads is tails, just call me lucifer
'cause i'm in need of some restraint
so if you meet me, have some courtesy
have some sympathy and some taste
use all your well-learned politesse
or i'll lay your soul to waste
mmm, yeah

pleased to meet you -- hope you guessed my name, mmm, yeah
but what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
mmm, mean it, get down

tell me baby, what's my name?
tell me honey, can 'ya guess my name?
tell me baby, what's my name?
i tell you one time, you're to blame

what's my name?
tell me baby, what's my name?
tell me sweetie, what's my name?
