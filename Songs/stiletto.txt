she cuts you once, she cuts you twice
but still you believe
the wound is so fresh you can taste the blood
but you don't have strength to leave

you've been bought, you've been sold
you've been locked outside the door
but you stand there pleadin'
with your insides bleedin'
'cause you deep down want some more

when she says she wants forgiveness
it's such a clever masquerade
she's so good with her stiletto
you don't even see the blade, you don't see the blade

oh, she cuts you hard, she cuts you deep
she's got so much skill
she's so fascinating
that you're still there waiting
when she comes back for the kill

you've been slashed in the face
you've been left there to bleed
you want to run away
but you know you're gonna stay
'cause she gives you what you need

then she says she needs affection
while she searches for the vein
she's so good with her stiletto
you don't really mind the pain, you don't mind the pain, woah, woah

she cuts you out, she cuts you down
she carves up your life
but you won't do nothng
as she keeps on cutting
'cause you know you love the knife

you've been bought, you've been sold
you've been locked outside the door
but you stand there pleadin'
with your insides bleedin'
'cause you deep down want some more

then she says she wants affection
while she searches for the vein
she's so good with her stiletto
you don't really mind the pain, you don't mind the pain
