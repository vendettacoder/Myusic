a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us

i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

and no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises

silent
silent
this is my final fit, my final bellyache with

no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises, please (let me out of here)
