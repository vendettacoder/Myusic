don't go near the water
don't you think it's sad
what's happened to the water
our water's going bad

oceans, rivers, lakes and streams
have all been touched by man
the poison floating out to sea
now threatens life on land

don't go near the water
ain't it sad
what's happened to the water
it's going bad

don't go near the water
don't go near the water

toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath
so let's avoid an ecological aftermath
beginning with me
beginning with you

don't go near the water
to do it any wrong
to be cool with the water
is the message of this song

let's all help the water
right away
do what we can and ought to
let's start today
