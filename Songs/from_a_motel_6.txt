you shouldn't hide but you always do
'cause even when you're gone i can see right through
you want disconnection
you want me there enough for two

pull a woolen blanket across my eyes
dream a quiet place for us to fight
oh no, your heart is broken
don't you think that's a little trite?

i climb where i can see
you're close but i won't reach
blank stare at the tv
cnn's on channel three

in the passing line on 1 and 9
stuck in sad, car stuck in drive
oh well, your heart is broken
well, you can have what's left of mine

i climb where i can see
you're close but i won't reach
blank stare at the tv
the howling ii's on channel three

oh, i drift off to sleep
while the snow falls on the screen
