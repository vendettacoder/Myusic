all right
rock 'n' roll

at the end of a dream
if you know where i mean
when the mist just starts to clear

in a similar way
at the end of today
i could feel the sound of writing on the wall

it cries for you
it's the least that you can do
like a spiral on the wind
i can hear it screamin' in my mind

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
let it live

in a different time
when the words didn't rhyme
you could never quite be sure

then on with the change
it was simple but strange
and you knew the feeling seemed to say it all

it cries for you
it's the least that you can do
like a spiral on the wind
i can hear it screaming in my mind

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
i'm losing control

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
look here

if you suddenly see
what has happened to me
you should spread the word around

and tell everyone here
that it's perfectly clear
they can sail above it all on what they've found

it cries for you
it's the best that you can do
like a sound that's everywhere
i can hear it screaming through the air

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
let it live, let it live, let it live

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll, yeah
long live rock and roll
better yell out with the crowd and it's

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
feel it down, spread it around, make a sound, it's got to be

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
live, live, live, live

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
lovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it

long live rock and roll
long live rock 'n' roll
long live rock and roll
