all i am i give to you
you'll honor me, i'll obey you
rich or poor or come what may
we'll forsake all other love
just we two, one flesh, one blood
in the eyes of god
i am yours to have &amp; hold
i'm giving you my lie...

never look at anyone, anyone but me
never look at anyone, i must be all you see
listen to those wedding bells
say goodbye to other girls
i'll never be untrue my love
don't be untrue to me
don't be untrue to me
don't be untrue to me
don't be untrue to me
don't be untrue to me
don't be untrue to me
