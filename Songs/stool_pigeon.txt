there's a gentleman that's going round
turning the joint upside down
stool pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha
he's an old ex-con that's been away
now he's back, no one's safe
stool pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha

if you wanna squeal, said the fbi
we can make a deal, make it worth your while
so he told it all and in return
he got a credit card and a thunderbird
and the maximum security
even after plastic surgery
so go on and squeal, said the fbi
we can make a deal, make it worth your while

there's a gentleman that's going round
turning the joint upside down
stool pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha
he's an old ex-con that's been away
now he's back, no one's safe
stool pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha

after all the talk then they wired him
and he took a walk with his crooked friends
and they joked about the good old days
and he recorded it on a reel of tape
he caught the mug who did in the forgery
and the babe in charge of larceny
so the fbi they rewarded him
because they like a guy who will stab a friend

there's a gentleman that's going round
turning the joint upside down
stool pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha
he's an old ex-con that's been away
now he's back, no one's safe
stool pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha

if you wanna squeal, said the fbi
we can make a deal, make it worth your while
so he told it all and in return
he got a credit card and a thunderbird
he got a spanking new identity
and a condo down in miami
he bought a plane, a boat and jewelry
but he couldn't buy any company
