you're just nineteen
but already the bitchiest queen
your room's a mess
i'm not impressed
but, damn, you have
the cutest dress

the world's not fair
you just can't deal with your despair
aspirins and alcohol 
are not enough to die, nicole

here's a party you're waiting for
make some room for the perfect whore
all your friends are arriving
mainstream hits and magazines

morning comes and you're not home
hey nicole, what have you done
what you've lost is memory
poor nicole

aspirins and alcohol
this is a cocktail for nicole
fuck nicole is out of control
call nicole and fuck nicole
alcopops and ketamine
this is a cocktail for my teen
fuck nicole is in my dream
that nicole is more than real

aspirins and alcohol
this is a cocktail for nicole
fuck nicole is out of control
call nicole and fuck nicole
alcopops and ketamine
this is a cocktail for my teen
fuck nicole is in my dream
that nicole is more than real

don't call your mom
her baby's gone
you're in disgrace
in your black dress
dry your tears
get on your feet

morning comes and you're not home
hey nicole, what have you done
what you've lost is memory
poor nicole

aspirins and alcohol
this is a cocktail for nicole
fuck nicole is out of control
call nicole and fuck nicole
alcopops and ketamine
this is a cocktail for my teen
fuck nicole is in my dream
that nicole is more than real
