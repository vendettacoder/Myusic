dear god, hope you got the letter, and
i pray you can make it better down here
i don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer
but all the people that you made in your image
see them starving on their feet
'cause they don't get enough to eat from god
i can't believe in you

dear god, sorry to disturb you, but 
i feel that i should be heard loud and clear
we all need a big reduction in amount of tears
and all the people that you made in your image
see them fighting in the street
'cause they can't make opinions meet about god
i can't believe in you

did you make disease and the diamond blue? 
did you make mankind after we made you? 
and the devil too

dear god, don't know if you noticed, but 
your name is on a lot of quotes in this book
us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look
and all the people that you made in your image
still believing that junk is true
well i know it ain't and so do you, dear god
i can't believe in
i don't believe in

i won't believe in heaven and hell
no saints, no sinners, no devil as well
no pearly gates, no thorny crown
you're always letting us humans down
the wars you bring, the babes you drown
those lost at sea and never found
and it's the same the whole world 'round
the hurt i see helps to compound
the father, son and holy ghost
is just somebody's unholy hoax
and if you're up there you'll perceive
that my heart's here upon my sleeve
if there's one thing i don't believe in

it's you
dear god
