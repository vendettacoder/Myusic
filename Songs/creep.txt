when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here, oh, oh

she's running out the door
she's running out
she run, run, run, run
run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here
i don't belong here
