narrator:
a lovestruck romeo sings the streets a serenade
laying everybody low with a love song that he made
finds a street light, steps out of the shade
says something like, "you and me babe, how about it?"

juliet says, "hey it's romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
he's underneath the window, she's singing, "hey la, my boyfriend's back
you shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that"
anyway, what you gonna do about it?

romeo:
juliet, the dice was loaded from the start,
and i bet, then you exploded in my heart,
and i forget, i forget, the movie song
when you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, juliet?

come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame,
both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same,
and i dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
how can you look at me as if i was just another one of your deals?

well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
you promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
now you just say, "oh romeo, yeah, you know i used to have a scene with him"

juliet, when we made love you used to cry
you said "i love you like the stars above, i'll love you till i die"
there's a place for us, you know the movie song
when you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, juliet?

i can't do the talk like the talk on the tv
and i can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
i can't do everything, but i'll do anything for you
i can't do anything 'cept be in love with you

and all i do is miss you, and the way we used to be
all i do is keep the beat, the bad company
and all i do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
julie, i'd do the stars with you, anytime

ah juliet, when we made love you used to cry
you said i love you like the stars above, i'll love you till i die
there's a place for us, you know the movie song
when you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, juliet?

narrator:

and says something like, "you and me babe, how 'bout it?"

romeo:
"you and me babe, how about it?"
