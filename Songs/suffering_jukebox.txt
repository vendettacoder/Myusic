planes on the downtown skyline is a sight to see for some
it ought to make a few reputations in the cult of number one
while these seconds turn these minutes into hours of the day
all these doubles drive the dollars and the light of day away

suffering jukebox such a sad machine
your filled up with what other people need
and they never seem to turn you up loud
there are a lot of chatterboxes in this crowd

suffering jukebox in a happy town
you're over in the corner breaking down
they always seem to keep you way down low
the people in this town don't want to know

well i guess all that mad misery must make it seem to true to you
but money lights your world up, you're trapped what can you do?
you got tennessee tendencies and chemical dependancies
you make the same old jokes and malaprops on cue

suffering jukebox such a sad machine
your filled up with what other people need
hardship, damnation and guilt
make you wonder why you were even built

suffering jukebox in a happy town
you're over in the corner breaking down
they always seem to keep you way down low
the people in this town don't want to know
