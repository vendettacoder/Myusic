see the stone set in your eyes
see the thorn twist in your side
i wait for you

sleight of hand and twist of fate
on a bed of nails she makes me wait
and i wait without you

with or without you
with or without you

through the storm, we reach the shore
you give it all but i want more
and i'm waiting for you

with or without you
with or without you
i can't live with or without you

and you give yourself away
and you give yourself away
and you give, and you give
and you give yourself away

my hands are tied, my body bruised
she's got me with nothing to win
and nothing left to lose

and you give yourself away
and you give yourself away
and you give, and you give
and you give yourself away

with or without you
with or without you
i can't live
with or without you

oh, oh, oh

with or without you
with or without you, oh
i can't live
with or without you
with or without you

ooh
ooh
