train whistle blowing makes a sleepy noise
underneath their blankets go all the girls and boys

rocking rolling riding out along the bay
all bound for morningtown many miles away

driver at the engine fireman rings the bell
sand man swings the lantern to show that all is well

rocking rolling riding out along the bay
all bound for morningtown many miles away

maybe it is raining where our train will ride;
all the little travellers are warm and snug inside

rocking rolling riding out along the bay
all bound for morningtown many miles away

somewhere there is sunshine somewhere there is day

somewhere there is morningtown many miles away

rocking rolling riding out along the bay
all bound for morningtown many miles away
all bound for morningtown many miles away
