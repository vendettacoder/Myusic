walk out,
girl don't you walk out
we've got things to say
talked out, let's have it talked out
things will be okay

girl
i don't want to find
that i'm a little bit wrong
and you're a little bit right
i said girl
you know that it's true
it's a little bit me, (a little bit me)
and it's a little bit you... too

don't know... just what i said wrong
but girl i apologize
don't go... here's where you belong
so wipe the tears from your eyes

girl
i don't want to find
that i'm a little bit wrong
and you're a little bit right

i said girl
you know that it's true
it's a little bit me
and it's a little bit you... too

oh girl
i don't want to find
i'm a little bit wrong
and you're a little bit right
i said girl
you know that it's true
it's a little bit me
and it's a little bit you... too

it's a little bit me
it's a little bit you
