i seem to recognize your face
haunting, familiar, yet
i can't seem to place it
cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
lifetimes are catching up with me
all these changes taking place
i wish i'd seen the place
but no one's ever taken me
hearts and thoughts they fade
fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade
fade away

i swear i recognize your breath
memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
me you wouldn't recall
for i'm not my former--it's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
i changed by not changing at all
small town predicts my fate
perhaps that's what no one wants to see
i just wanna scream hello
my god, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd return
but now here you are, and here i am
hearts and thoughts, they fade
away

hearts and thoughts, they fade
fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade
fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade
away, yeah
hearts and thoughts, they fade
fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade
fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade
fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade
