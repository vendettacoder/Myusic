the cab driver blowin'
and my bags are all packed
as i start towards the door,
my heart keeps pulling me back
my mind's on leaving, but my heart won't let me go

'cause the picture hung us on the wall
brings back memories of how love used to be
and just like i've done before
i turn and close the door, hate myself once more

i ran to my room, fell across the bed
tears on a pillow, i wish that i were dead
my heart knows how much i love you
but i hate the agony you put me through
what ever happened to the plans that we made?
all i'm living on is a little love i saved

yes, you would locked me out your life
we no longer share 'cause you no longer care
the past keeps me hangin' on
to the love you gave, the love i still prayed
mm-hmm-mmm, mm-hmm-mmm
i hate i need ya

each day it takes a little bit more of me
my mind's no longer a part of me
my heart can't forget how love used to be
and i'm holding on to sweet memories
what ever happened to the plans that we made?
all i'm living on is a little love i saved

the cab driver blowin'
and my bags are all packed
as i start towards the door,
my heart keeps pulling me back
my mind's on leaving, but my heart won't let me go
my mind's on leaving, but my heart won't let me go
