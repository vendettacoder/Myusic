blind faith, heartache
mind games, mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole

i want it all
i want it all

old dogs, new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle

i want it all
i want it all

and then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
said ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa
shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa
shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa, shoo-wa

i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
