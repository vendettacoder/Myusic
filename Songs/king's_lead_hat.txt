dark alley (dark alley) black star
four turkeys in a big black car
the road is shiny (bright shine) the wheels slide
four turkeys going for a dangerous ride
the lacquer crackles (black tar) the engines roar
a ship was turning broadside to the shore
splish splash i was raking in the cash
the biology of purpose keeps my nose above the surface, oh

king's lead hat put the innocence inside her
it will come, it will come, it will surely come
king's lead hat was a mother to desire
it will come, it will come, it will surely come

in new delhi (smelly delhi) and hong kong
they all know that it won't be long
i count my fingers (digit counter) as night falls
and draw bananas on the bathroom walls
the killer cycles (humdrum) the killer hertz
the passage of my life is measured out in shirts
time and motion (motion carried) time and tide
all i know and all i have is time and time and tide is on my side

king's lead hat put the poker in the fire
it will come, it will come, it will surely come
king's lead hat was a mother to desire
it will come, it will come, it will surely come

the weapon's ready (ready freddy) the guns purr
the satellite distorts his voice to a slur
he gives orders (finger pie) which no one hears
the king's hat fits over their ears
he takes his modicate (indecipherable) cold turpentine
he tries to dial out 999999999
he dials reception (moving finger) he's all alone
he's just a victim of the telephone

king's lead hat made the amazon much wider
it will come, it will come, it will surely come
king's lead hat put the poker in the fire
it will come, it will come, it will surely come
king's lead hat was a mother to desire
it will come, it will come, it will surely come
king's lead hat put the innocence inside her
it will come, it will come, it will surely come
