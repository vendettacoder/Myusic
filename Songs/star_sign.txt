(gerard love)

hey there's a horseshoe on my door; big deal.
and say there's a black cat on the floor, big deal.

if these things make your day
well if these things change your day

well do you know where you belong?
and is your star sign ever wrong?

if these things change your day,
well if these things make your day
seen it all before, seen it all before...
in a time these things will change

hey there's a side of me unknown, big deal.
and say, should this unknown force be shown, big deal.

if these thoughts make your day
well if these thoughts change your day
seen it all before, seen it all before
given time these things will change
seen it all before, seen it all before
given time these things will change.

if these things change your day
well if this song makes your day.
seen it all before, seen it all before
given time these things will change
seen it all before, seen it all before
given time these things will change
