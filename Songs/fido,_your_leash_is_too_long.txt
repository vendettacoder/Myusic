fido, your leash is too long
you go where you don't belong
you've been digging in the rubble
gettin' bitches in trouble
fido, your leash is too long

fido, your leash is too long
i don't know where i went wrong
you scare me out of my wits 
when you do that shih tzu
fido, your leash is too long

fido, you've gone far enough
i must have all of your love
you just run out of luck
i don't care what you foxhounds
do, but your leash is too long
