daydream
i fell asleep amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, on a beautiful day

daydream
i dream of you amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, such a beautiful day

i dream a dirty dream of you baby
you're crawling on the bathroom floor
you float around the room and you're naked
then you're flying out the bedroom door
i dream a dirty dream

i dream a dirty dream

daydream
i fell asleep amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, on a beautiful day
daydream
i dream of you amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, such a beautiful day.

i dream a dirty dream of you baby
you're swinging from the chandelier
i'm climbing up the walls 'cause i want you
but when i reach you, you disappear
i dream a dirty dream

i dream a dirty dream

i dirty dream
i dirty dream
i dirty dream
dream

daydream
i fell asleep amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, on a beautiful day

daydream 
i dream of you amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, such a beautiful day

daydream
i fell asleep amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, on a beautiful day

daydream 
i dream of you amid the flowers
for a couple of hours, such a beautiful day
