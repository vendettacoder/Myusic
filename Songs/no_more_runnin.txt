"no more runnin'," says my mind
all this movement has just proved, your kisses are too fine

all the harmony that i'd seen
friends i once had turn their thoughts away from me

no more runnin', i've got to breathe
on back porches with the torch of a firefly-lit tree

it's what i'd hoped for
it's what i'd hoped for
no more runnin'
no more runnin'

well, lock my bones and trip my feet
tell them, find a place to be

stick like candy in your teeth
will you lose your faith in me?

"no more runnin'," says my mind
all this movement has just proved, your kisses hard to find

it's what i'd hoped for
it's what i'd hoped for
no more runnin'
no more runnin'
no more runnin'
no more runnin'
