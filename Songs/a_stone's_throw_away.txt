for liberty there is a cost - its broken skulls and leather cosh,
from the boys in uniform - now you know whose side their on -
with backing - with blessing,
from earthly gods not heaven,
a stones throw away from it all.

whatever pleasures those who get - from stripping skin with rhino whip,
are the kind that must be stopped - before their kind take all we've got -
with loving - with caring,
they take great pride in working,
the stones throw away from it all.

whenever honesty persists - you'll hear the snap of broken ribs,
of anyone who'll take no more - of the lying bastards roar -
in chile - in poland,
johannesburg - south yorkshire,
a stones throw away: now we're there.
