walk in silence
don't walk away, in silence
see the danger
always danger
endless talking
life rebuilding
don't walk away

walk in silence
don't turn away, in silence
your confusion
my illusion
worn like a mask of self-hate
confronts and then dies
don't walk away

people like you find it easy
aching to see
walking on air
hunting by the rivers
through the streets
every corner abandoned too soon
set down with due care
don't walk away, in silence
don't walk away
