day after day
i will walk and i will play
but the day after today
i will stop and i will start

why can't i get just one kiss?
why can't i get just one kiss?
there may be some things that i wouldn't miss
but i look at your pants and i need a kiss
why can't i get just one screw?
why can't i get just one screw?
believe me, i know what to do
but something won't let me make love to you

why can't i get just one fuck?
why can't i get just one fuck?
i guess it's got something to do with luck
but i waited my whole life for just one...

day after day
i get angry and i will say
that the day is in my sight
when i'll take a bow and say goodnight

oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum
have you kept your eye, your eye on your son?
i know you've had problems, you're not the only one
when your sugar left, he left you on the run
oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum
take a look now at what your boy has done
he's walking around like he's number one
went downtown and you got him a gun

so don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
you know you've got my sympathy
but don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
you know you've got my sympathy
but don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me

broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs
can i mix in with your affairs?
share a smoke, make a joke
grasp and reach for a leg of hope
words to memorize, words hypnotize
words make my mouth exercise
words all fail the magic prize
nothing i can say when i'm in your thighs

well, moma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother
i would love to love you, lover
city is restless, it's ready to pounce
go! here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce
and, moma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother
i would love to love you, lover
city is restless, it's ready to pounce
go here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce

i've given you a decision to make
things to lose, things to take
just as she's about ready to cut it up
she says, "wait a minute, honey, i'm gonna - add it up!"

add it up
add it up (hey!)
add it up
add it up (oh!)
add it up
add it up (say what you got, you gotta...)
add it up (..., baby!)
(add it up, add it up) ma-ma-ma, day after day
(add it up, add it up) i get angry and i will say
(add it up, add it up) that the day is in my sight
(add it up, add it up) when i'll take a bow and say goodnight
(add it up, add it up)
