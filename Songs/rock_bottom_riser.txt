i love my mother
i love my father
i love my sisters, too.
i bought this guitar
to pledge my love
to pledge my love to you.

i am a rock bottom riser
and i owe it all to you
i am a rock bottom riser
and i owe it all to you

i saw a gold ring
at the bottom of the river
glinting at my foolish heart
so my foolish heart
had to go diving
diving, diving, diving
into the murk

and from the bottom of the river
i looked up for the sun
which had shattered in the water
and pieces were rained down
like gold rings 
that passed through my hands
as i thrashed and i grabbed
i started rising, rising, rising

i left my mother
i left my father
i left my sisters, too
i left them standing on the banks
and they pulled me out
of this mighty, mighty, mighty river

i am a rock bottom riser
and i owe it all to you
i am a rock bottom riser
and i owe it all to you

i love my mother
i love my father
i love my sisters, too.
i bought this guitar
to pledge my love
to pledge my love to you
