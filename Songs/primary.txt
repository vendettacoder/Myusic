the innocence of sleeping children dressed in white and slowly dreaming stops all time
i slow my steps and start to blur, so many years have filled my heart, i never thought i'd say those words

(the further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
the further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)

the very first time i saw your face i thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
the very first time i touched your skin i thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon
oh, remember. oh, please don't change

so the fall came, thirteen years, a shiny ring and how i could forget your name
the air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same

so they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

(the further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
the further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)
