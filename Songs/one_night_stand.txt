every night - a different town - i sing my song
i play and sing - pack my things and move along

a pretty face, another place i never get to know
a one night stand, another show

my guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame

if i could do what i want to, i'd stay and never go
a one night stand is all i know

i wish that i could be two people
instead of bein' on my own
i wish that i could be two people
and then i'd never be alone



photographs of where i've been and all i've done
in this whole world - is there a girl - no, not one

goodbye, hello - i've got to go - i hope you understand
a one night man is all i am
a one night stand, a one night man.

doo doo doo...

goodbye, hello - i've got to go - i hope you understand
a one night man is all i am
a one night stand, a one night man

doo doo doo...
