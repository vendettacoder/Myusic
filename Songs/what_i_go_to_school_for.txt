oh, yeah yeah

her voice is echoed in my mind
i count the days 'til she is mine 
can't tell my friends 'cos they will laugh 
i love a member of the staff 
i fight my way to front of class 
to get the best view of her ass 
i drop the pencil on the floor 
she bends down and shows me more,

that's what i go to school for 
even though it is a real bore 
you can call me crazy 
i know that she craves me 
that's what i go to school for 
even though it is a real bore 
girlfriends i've had plenty 
none like miss mackenzie 
that's what i go to school for 
that's what i go to school for 

so she maybe thirty three 
but that doesn't bother me 
her boyfriend's working out of town 
i find a reason to go round 
i climb a tree outside her home 
to make sure that she's alone 
i've see her in her underwear 
i can't help but stop and stare 

that's what i go to school for
even though it is a real bore
you can call me crazy
but i know that she craves me
that's what i go to school for
even though it is a real bore
girlfriends i've had plenty
none like miss mckenzie
that's what i go to school for
that's what i go to school for

everyone that you teach all day 
knows you're looking at me in a different way 
i guess, that's why 
my marks are getting so high 
i could see those tell tale signs 
telling me that i was on your mind 
i could see that you wanted more 
when you told me that i'm what you go to school for 
i'm what you go to school for 

she's packed her bag it's in the trunk 
looks like she picked herself a hunk 
we drive by school to say goodbye 
my friends they can't believe their eyes 

that's what i go to school for
even though it is a real bore
you can call me crazy
but i know that she craves me
that's what i go to school for
even though it is a real bore
girlfriends i've had plenty
none like miss mackenzie
that's what i go to school for
that's what i go to school for.
