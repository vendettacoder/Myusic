album version:
you keep pouring into one glass and you're never changing the straw

single version:
and now to sing this lovely ballad, here is mama cass

stars shining bright above you
night breezes seem to whisper "i love you"
birds singin' in the sycamore tree
dream a little dream of me

say "nighty-night" and kiss me
just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
while i'm alone and blue as can be
dream a little dream of me

stars fading but i linger on, dear
still craving your kiss
i'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
just saying this

sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
but in your dreams, whatever they be
dream a little dream of me

stars fading but i linger on, dear
still craving your kiss
i'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
just saying this

sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
but in your dreams, whatever they be
dream a little dream of me
