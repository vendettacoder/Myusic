i want a dog, a chihuahua
when i get back to my small flat
i want to hear somebody bark
oh, you can get lonely
i want a dog

don't want a cat
scratching its claws all over my habitat
giving no love and getting fat
oh, you can get lonely
and a cat's no help with that

bulldog, hound and pug, and labrador
collie, retriever and doberman pinscher
husky, dalmatian, saint bernard und dachshund
mongrel, beagle, cocker spaniel

i want a dog
to walk in the park
when it gets dark
my dog will bark at any passers-by
oh, you can get lonely
i want a dog

i want a dog, a chihuahua
when i get back to my small flat
i want to hear somebody bark
oh, you can get lonely
