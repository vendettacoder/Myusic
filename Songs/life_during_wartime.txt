heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
packed up and ready to go
heard of some grave sites, out by the highway
a place where nobody knows

the sound of gunfire, off in the distance
i'm getting used to it now
lived in a brownstone, lived in a ghetto
i've lived all over this town

this ain't no party, this ain't no disco
this ain't no fooling around
no time for dancing, or lovey dovey
i ain't got time for that now

transmit the message, to the receiver
hope for an answer some day
i got three passports, a couple of visas
you don't even know my real name

high on a hillside, the trucks are loading
everything's ready to roll
i sleep in the daytime, i work in the nighttime
i might not ever get home

this ain't no party, this ain't no disco
this ain't no fooling around
this ain't no mudd club, or c.b.g.b.
i ain't got time for that now

heard about houston? heard about detroit?
heard about pittsburgh, pa?
you oughta know not to stand by the window
somebody see you up there

i got some groceries, some peanut butter
to last a couple of days
but i ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
ain't got no records to play

why stay in college? why go to night school?
gonna be different this time
can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
i ain't got time for that now

trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
we blended in with the crowd
we got computers, we're tapping phone lines
i know that that ain't allowed

we dress like students, we dress like housewives
or in a suit and a tie
i changed my hairstyle, so many times now
i don't know what i look like

you make me shiver, i feel so tender
we make a pretty good team
don't get exhausted, i'll do some driving
you ought to get you some sleep

burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
they won't help me survive
my chest is aching, burns like a furnace
the burning keeps me alive

get your instructions, follow directions
then you should change your address
maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day
whatever you think is best

try to stay health, physical fitness
don't want to catch no disease
try to be careful, don't take no chances
better watch what you say
