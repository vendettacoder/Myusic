each is not my love, moan i for what
i make up hundreds so i know how to make love
there, you can have my youth, i know i have loved
started to see him, 'till when i married him

to yearn admits you're outside to me
grow up

i have seen these all my life, perhaps a lot more
and i have been so naive
all move and try he knew not
and your spangle, how it hurts, and i have feelings

to yearn admits you're outside to me
grow up

to yearn admits you're outside to me
grow up
