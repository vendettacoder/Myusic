i am a sensitive artist

i am a sensitive artist
nobody understands me because i am so deep
in my work i make allusions to books that nobody else has read
music that nobody else has heard
and art that nobody else has seen
i can't help it
because i am so much more intelligent
and well-rounded
than everyone who surrounds me

i stopped watching tv when i was six months old
because it was so boring and stupid
and started reading books
and going to recitals
and art galleries

i don't go to recitals anymore
because my hearing is too sensitive
and i don't go to art galleries anymore
because there are people there
and i can't deal with people
because they don't understand me

i stay home
reading books that are beneath me
and working on my work
which no one understands

i am sensitive
