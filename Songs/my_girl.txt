my girl's mad at me
i didn't wanna see the film tonight
i found it hard to say
she thought i'd had enough of her

why can't she see
she's lovely to me?
but i like to stay in
and watch tv on my own
every now and then

my girl's mad at me
been on the telephone for an hour
we hardly said a word
i tried and tried but i could not be heard

why can't i explain?
why do i feel this pain?
'cause everything i say
she doesn't understand
she doesn't realise
she takes it all the wrong way

my girl's mad at me
we argued just the other night
i thought we'd got it straight
we talked and talked until it was light

i thought we'd agreed
i thought we'd talked it out
now when i try to speak
she says that i don't care
she says i'm unaware
and now she says i'm weak
