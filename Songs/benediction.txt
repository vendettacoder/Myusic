so, you don't get to be a saint
martyrs never last this long
guess i'll never be the one
to defeat desire in song

here's a marker
here's my naked skin
our exhibit a
put a small x where i lost my way

all the actors broke their legs
and it's too late to postpone
the producer's getting high
and the audience went home

smile and take your awkward bow
turn and stumble off the stage
let the rain be your applause
and every encore soothe your rage

squint with one eye
hum a show tune, wait
for your ride to say
oh, that's where you must have lost your way

megaphones in helicopters squeal
"hey, are you okay?"
searchlights circle
where we lost our way

all our accidents went purposeful and fell
stripped of providence or any way to tell
our intentions were intangible and sweet
sick with simple math and shy discoveries
piled up against our impending defeat
