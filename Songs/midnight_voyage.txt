on a midnight voyage
one that has no ending
and it's sending me for things that i need

far away from shore
further than i've been before
but i feel the strain of the new sea

dreams come and go and i sift through them
love starts to grow from the thoughts that i find within them

on a midnight voyage
searching for my pleasure
reaching with my mind for something i've dreamed

loves come and go and i dream through them
dreams start to flow from the love that i find within them

on a midnight voyage
one that has no ending
and it's sending me right into my mind
