all the old paintings on the tomb
they do the sand dance, don't you know?
if they move too quick (oh-way-oh)
they're falling down like a domino

all the bazaar men by the nile
they got the money on a bet
gold crocodiles (oh-way-oh)
they snap their teeth on your cigarette

foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
walk like an egyptian

the blonde waitresses take their trays
they spin around and they cross the floor
they've got the moves (oh-way-oh)
you drop your drink, then they bring you more

all the school kids so sick of books
they like the punk and the metal band
when the buzzer rings (oh-way-oh)
they're walking like an egyptian

all the kids in the marketplace say
(way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
walk like an egyptian

slide your feet up the street, bend your back
shift your arm, then you pull it back
life is hard you know (oh-way-oh)
so strike a pose on a cadillac

if you want to find all the cops
they're hanging out in the donut shop
they sing and dance (oh-way-oh)
they spin the clubs, cruise down the block

all the japanese with their yen
the party boys call the kremlin
and the chinese know (oh-way-oh)
they walk the line like egyptian

all the cops in the donut shop say
(way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
walk like an egyptian
walk like an egyptian
