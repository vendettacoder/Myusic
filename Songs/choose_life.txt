choose life. 
choose a job. 
choose a career. 
choose a family, 
choose a fucking big television
choose washing machines, cars, 
compact disc players, and electrical tin openers. 
choose good health, low cholesterol 
and dental insurance. 
choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. 
choose a starter home. 
choose your friends. 
choose leisure wear and matching luggage. 
choose a three piece suite on hire purchase 
in a range of fucking fabrics. 
choose diy and wondering who you 
are on a sunday morning. 
choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing 
sprit-crushing ga me shows
stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. 
choose rotting away at the end of it all, 
pishing you last in a miserable home
nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish,
fucked-up brats 
you have spawned to replace yourself. 
choose your future. choose life.
