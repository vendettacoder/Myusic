there's a new sensation
a fabulous creation
a danceable solution
to teenage revolution

do the strand, love
when you feel love
it's the new way
that's why we say
do the strand

do it on the tables
quaglino's place or mabel's

slow and gentle
sentimental
all styles served here
louis seize he prefer
laissez-faire le strand

tired of the tango
fed up with fandango

dance on moonbeams
slide on rainbows
in furs or blue jeans
you know what i mean
do the strand

had your fill of quadrilles
the madison and cheap thrills
bored with the beguine
the samba isn't your scene

they're playing our tune
by the pale moon
we're incognito
down the lido
and we like the strand

arabs at oases
eskimos and chinese

if you feel blue
look through who's who
see la goulue
and nijinsky
do the strandsky

weary of the waltz
and mashed potato schmaltz

rhododendron
is a nice flower
evergreenin'
it lasts forever
but it can't beat strand power

the sphynx and mona lisa
lolita and guernica
did the strand
