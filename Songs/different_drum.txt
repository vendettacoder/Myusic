you and i travel to the beat of a different drum
oh, can't you tell by the way i run
every time you make eyes at me

you cry, and moan, and say it'll work out
but honey child, i've got my doubts
you can't see the forest for the trees

don't get me wrong, it's not that i'd knock it
it's just that i, i'm not in the market
for a girl who wants to love only me

and i ain't saying you ain't pretty
all i'm saying's i'm not ready
for any person place or thing
to try and pull the reins in on me

so, goodbye, i don't believe
and i see no sense
in this crying and grieving
we'll both live a lot longer
if you live without me
