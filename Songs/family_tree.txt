anda my love
wake up to your window 
the day calls in billows 
it's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart
in cosy red rainbow 
it's shaking off halos 
and the memory of our sacred so and so's

oh, take my hand sweet 
complete your release
unbury your feet 
and married we'll be
alone in receiving ours is a feeling
not that they would see
they don't know that we could be 
down where your cradle escaped the sea 
and your raven-haired mama caught told you so's

we're laying in the shadow of your family tree 
your haunted heart and me
brought down by an old idea whose time has come 
and in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree 
there's a hundred hearts or three
pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young 

ah me all mine
is it safe to say that we've waited patiently 
call me on time 
and recall the tune that has placed us gracefully 
all into line 
there's a garden grave and a place there saved for you 
i fall by your side 
though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's 

we're laying in the shadow of your family tree
your haunted heart and me
brought down by an old idea whose time has come
and in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
there's a hundred hearts or three
pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young

now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree
in halted harmony
brought down by an old idea whose time has come 
and in the shadow of the valley of your family tree
there's a hundred hearts or three
pumping blood to the roots of eden to keep us young
