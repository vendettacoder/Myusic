searching for mr right
waiting up half the night
feeling like i'll be dead
before i'm old
teaching myself to be
the young untold
how can i hope to be
someone for you to see?

blind as the fate decrees
i will go on
teaching myself to be
the young untold
am i in vain tonight?
lose you against the light
who can you be
mr right?
