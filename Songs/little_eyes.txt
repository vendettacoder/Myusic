took a walk alone last night, slept inside your head
it was raining hard again, crawled back into bed
tried to catch up to you but you moved too fast
thought about a million things, fell asleep at last
got up again last night, tore all over town
skidding tires, screeching brakes barely make a sound
we were on a winding road going 65
slid along an icy stretch, made it back alive

little eyes are open but they don't see very far
you can only hurt the ones you love, not the ones you're thinking of
little eyes are open but they're sinking back again
don't you know you're sleeping much too long, wake up little eyes, little eyes

moving but not gaining any ground
climbing up the escalator as it takes you down
last night i heard this sound echoed everywhere
like a buzzing amplifier burning through the air
it's still raining hard, you said, have you any clue?
is it ever gonna stop? i guess that's up to you

little eyes are open but they don't see very far
you can only hurt the ones you love, not the ones you're thinking of
little eyes are open but they're sinking back again
don't you know you're sleeping much too long, wake up little eyes, little eyes
little eyes, little eyes, little eyes, wake up little eyes
