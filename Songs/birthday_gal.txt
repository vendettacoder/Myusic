wax is dripping from the frosting on the cake
come on girl, buckle up, and don't hesitate
take a deep breath and blow 'em all away

we sang off-key and all the dishes china-blue
remember, don't tell a soul, that wish, it won't come true
hey sad face on your lucky day

birthday gal, did you wish yet?
can you handle the turn?  the candles are burnin' low
birthday gal, did you wish that...
there weren't quite as many candles that you had to blow?

hair falls down all around the eyes that close
she might wear them earrings but she won't wear the clothes
oh, hang 'em up with all the ones that don't fit no more

i thought this was a party, so come on let's lighten up
no one gets a slice until we make the first cut
no, we'll leave the lights down, she's ready now and this is here

birthday gal, did you wish yet?
can you handle the turn?  the candles are burnin' low
birthday gal, did you wish that...
there weren't quite as many candles that you had to blow?

birthday gal, did you wish yet?

make a wish, make a wish...
