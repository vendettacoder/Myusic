bang there was you too gold too blue 
you told the truth, i cried, you flew
you called me mad (and i am mad) as a hatter
some fall in love i shatter

you make it rain, too bleak, too stark
should night not fall you make things dark... 
you called me mad (and i am mad) as a hatter
some fall in love i shatter

bang here am i no one nowhere
no ground no sky, no light no air
you called me mad (and i am mad) as a hatter
some fall in love i shatter
