i thought love was only true in fairy tales
meant for someone else but not for me

love was out to get me
that's the way it seemed
disappointment haunted all my dreams

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace, of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer
i couldn't leave her if i tried

i thought love was more or less, a givin' thing
seems the more i gave the less i got

whats the use in tryin'
all you get is pain
when i needed sunshine i got rain

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace, of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer
i couldn't leave her if i tried
