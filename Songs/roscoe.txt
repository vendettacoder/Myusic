stonecutters made them from stones 
chosen specially for you and i 
who will live inside 
the mountaineers gathered tinder 
piled high 
in which to take along
driving many miles, knowing they'd get here

when they got here, all exhausted 
on the roof leaks they got started 
and now when the rain comes 
we can be thankful 

ooh aah ooh 
when the mountaineers 
saw that everything fit they were 
glad and so they took off

thought we were due for 
a change or two 
around this place 
when they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

the village used to be all one really needs 
that's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals 
that mostly surround you 
you wish to flee but it's not like you 
to listen to me, listen to me 

oh, oh, oh and when the morning comes, 
we will step outside 
we will not find another man in sight
we like the newness, the newness of all 
that has grown in our garden soaking for so long 

whenever i was a child i wondered what if my name had changed 
into something more productive like roscoe 
been born in 1891 
waiting with my aunt rosaline 

thought we were due 
for a change or two 
around this place 
when they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

1891 
they roamed around and foraged
they made their house from cedars 
they made their house from stones 

oh, they're a little like you
and they're a little like me 
we have all we need 

thought we were due for 
a change or two 
around this place 
this place 
this place

when they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 
when they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
