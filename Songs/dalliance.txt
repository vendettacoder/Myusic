you've told him lies now for so long 
yet still he's ready to forgive 
he's got you back and that's all he wants 
a lot more than i'm left with 

you don't care now that you're gone 
but do you know how much i miss you?
it's not fair after all you've done 
that i'm so...i still want to kiss you 

and throwing presents straight away 
because you could never take them home 
always scared what he might say
but always leaving me alone 

you don't care, now that you're gone 
but do you know how much i miss you?
it's not fair after all you've done 
that i'm so... i still want to kiss you 

you told him what he wants to hear 
and so you got another chance 
but i was yours for seven years 
is that what you call a dalliance? 

you don't care, now that you're gone 
but do you know how much i miss you?
it's not fair after all you've done 
that i'm so... i still want to kiss you
