we're takin' calls on the wish line
making all your wacky wishes come true

hello

i wish i was little bit taller, i wish i was a baller,
i wish i had a girl who looked good i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a 64' impala

i wish i was like six-foot-nine 
so i can get with leoshi, cause she don't know me, but yo she's really fine
you know i see her all the time
everywhere i go and even in my dreams i can scheme a way to make her mine
cause i know she's livin phat
her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am i gonna compete with that
'cause when it comes to playing basketball
i'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
so i just lean up on the wall
or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their men ball
dag y'all! i never understood, black
why the jocks get the fly girls and me i get the hood rats
i tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
got hit with a bottle and i been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
i confess it's a shame 
when you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
glad i came to my senses 
like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach overcommeth 
by the thoughts of me and her together, right? 
so when i asked her out she said i wasn't her type

i wish i was little bit taller, i wish i was a baller,
i wish i had a girl who looked good i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a 64' impala

i wish i was little bit taller, i wish i was a baller,
i wish i had a girl who looked good i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a 64' impala

i wish i had a brand-new car, so far i got this hatchback 
and everywhere i go, yo i gets laughed at
and when i'm in my car, i'm laid back
i got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
and do you really wanna know what's really whack
see i can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
i heard that prom night is a bomb night with the hood rats you can hold tight, but really tho' 
i 'm a figaro when i'm in my car i can't even get a hello
well so many people wanna cruise crenshaw on sunday
well then i'ma have to get in my car and go
you know i take the 110 until the 105
get off at crenshaw tell my homies look alive
cause it's hard to survive 
when your livin' in a concrete jungle and these girls just keep passin' me by
she looks fly, she looks fly
makes me say my, my, my
