i don't wanna go fighting in the tropical heat
i hate the civil service rules
i won't open a letter bomb for you

every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
career opportunity, the ones that never knock

career opportunities, the ones that never knock
every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
career opportunity, the ones that never knock

career, career, career
