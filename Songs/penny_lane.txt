in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he's had the pleasure to know
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello

on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain
very strange

penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back

in penny lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
it's a clean machine

penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
four of fish and finger pies in summer
meanwhile back

behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
a pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and though she feels as if she's in a play
she is anyway

in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain
very strange

penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back

penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
penny lane
