some expression in your eyes
overtook me by surprise
where was i
how was i to know?
how can we drive to a movie show
when the music is here in my car?

there's a band playing on the radio
with a rhythm of rhyming guitars
they're playing "oh yeah" on the radio

and so it came to be our song
and so on through all summer long
day and night drifting into love
driving you home from a movie show
so in tune to the sounds in my car

there's a band playing on the radio
with a rhythm of rhyming guitars
they're playing "oh yeah" on the radio

it's some time since we said goodbye
and now we lead our separate lives
but where am i, where can i go?
driving alone to a movie show
so i turn to the sounds in my car

there's a band playing on the radio
with a rhythm of rhyming guitars
there's a band playing on the radio
and it's drowning the sound of my tears
they're playing "oh yeah" on the radio
