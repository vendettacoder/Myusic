he was in life as he was in death
a well remebered man
his life was taken like a sudden breath
that simply wasn't planned
and all that's left to say
written on his grave it says:
in memory of
in all the essence of a friendship he,
was never so cold or sad
he tried so hard as he struggled in
what little time he had
no more return to home
written on his stone it says
in memory of
and now he's gone all that's left behind
is a legacy
in the pages of a magazine
eft in time to read
the only thing that's said
a memory of his life
written at it's head it says
all this left behind
