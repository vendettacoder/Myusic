yo, this song, yo
this song is for all the women out there
that have been lied to by their men
and i know y'all been lied to over and over again
this is for y'all
yo, maybe you didn't break the way you should have broke, yo
but i break, know what i am saying, this is how it goes y'all, damn

last year, valentine's day, you would spoil me, you say
"babe, i love you, love you babe i swear"
held you when you were sick even (sucked your dick)
the whole time i think to myself, this isn't fair

what is this i see (no)
you don't come home to me (oh, no)
when you don't come home to me (man)
can't deal, can't bear

you keep tellin' me lies
but to your surprise
look, i found her red coat
and your (bitch) caught out there

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

i hate you so much right now

so sick of your games, i'll set your truck to flames
and watch it blow up, blow up, tell me (how you gonna see her now)
so far from sincere {i love you}, fabrications in my ear
drive me so far up the wall, i come slidin' down

what is this i see (i don't believe this)
you don't come home to me
when you don't come home to me
i can't deal, can't bear (i won't)

you keep tellin' me lies
but to your surprise
look, i hope you're happy
since you're caught out there

yeah, you've been caught
yo', come on
come on

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

(she's so) raunchy, so vulgar, not me, why the hell her
look, she dresses (look at her) a mess, what do you see (i don't know)
it's not all about cash (hell, no), not how much you flash
how i dress is a reflection of me

what is this i see
you don't come home to me (uh-uh)
when you don't come home to me
can't deal, can't bear (told you i won't)

you keep tellin' me lies
but to your surprise
look, i got somethin' for y'all
since you're caught out there

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
i hate you so much right now
ahh...

i hate you so much right now
