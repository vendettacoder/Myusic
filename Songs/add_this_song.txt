add this song to your heart
let it beat in your chest real hard

add this song to your head
when you wake up and go out of bed

add this song to your list
play it til it no more exist

through the pain of the snow
is there nowhere to go
like i'm stuck in the state
of no state at all

as i wandered alone in the darkest night
heard this song at the rave
and it saved my life

add this song to your heart
let it beat in your chest real hard

add this song to your day
let it be about you and me

add this song to your life
