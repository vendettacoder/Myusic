maybe i should entertain
the very fact that i'm insane
i wasn't fooling when i said
all the people i like are those that are dead
i've been around this town and i've seen what god has done
i've been around and it's no fun
i've been a two-timer/tearaway god has told me so
but i don't believe in him you know
don't make me a martyr for our causes
'cause i don't believe a word that you said
all the people i like are those are dead
maybe i shoud take a gun
and put it to the head of everyone
all the people i like are in the ground
it's better to be lost than to be found
i should listen hard to the voices from within
they are telling me that i'll never win
i should save myself i shoud save myself from sin
but i wouldn't know where to begin
you are trying to tell me what you believe in
but i ain't got a clue what you are talking about
it's better to be a man than to be a mouse
all the people i like are those that are dead
all the people i like are those that are dead
all the people i like are those that are dead
all the people i like are those that are dead
i've been around this town and i've seen what god has done
i've been around and it's no fun
i've been a two-timer/tearaway god has told me so
but i don't believe in him you know
don't make me a martyr for our causes
'cause i don't believe a word that you said
all the people i like are those that are
all the people i like are those that are
all the people i like are those that are dead.
