david's on piano, and i may play on a drum
and we'll try to make the music work, we'll try to have some fun
but i just can't help thinking that if you were here with me
i'd get all my thoughts in focus and play more excitingly

i love you still, caroline
i want you still, caroline
i need you still, caroline

if you call this sentimental crap you'll make me mad
'cause you know that i would not sing about some passing fad
and if my attempts at rhyming aren't convincing to your ear
then memories betray you through the passing of the year

i love you still, caroline
i want you still, caroline
i need you still, caroline

you must think it doubtful that i mean the words i sing
or that all attempts to reach you this way could not mean a thing
but you must admit we both thought we'd be man and wife
and that i could make you happy for the best part of your life

i love you still, caroline
i love you still, caroline
i love you still, caroline
i love you still, caroline
(repeat to fade)
