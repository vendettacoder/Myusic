hi i'm 17 and my name is bobby james 
everyday in school all my classmates call me names 
and so this pusher introduced me to this thing 
he said it makes you forget pain but makes you sing 
i got pushed at home at school i was a wuss 
now my life is a domino that pushers push 
cause i tried it once but i tried it again 
ran away two weeks later i seen my friend 
and i said 
[chorus - 2x] 
hey there mister give me some cash 
i'm high as hell and i'm ready to blast 
i'm just one hit away from being passed out 
young and assed out 
man this would be cute if this were just a dream 
a lesson for you to learn except you'd learn through me 
you know like in the movies when it ends with a scream 
well fuck face i got news this is real and i did things 
traveling from virginia to cali broke 
hitchhike and rides me in my calico 
shoplift for food when it was desire 
i miss my family 
miss my friends 
i'm so high and so tired 
[chorus] 
[2x] 
hey there 
would you help me please 
could you spare some change for the world 
for the world to see 
[chorus]
