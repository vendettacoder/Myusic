lucy liu, with my girl
drew
cameron d
and destiny
charlie's angels, come on

question: tell me what you think about me
i buy my own diamonds and i buy my own rings
only ring your cell-y when i'm feelin' lonely
when it's all over, please get up and leave

question: tell me how you feel about this
try to control me boy, you get dismissed
pay my own fun and i pay my own bills
always fifty-fifty in relationships

the shoes on my feet (i bought it)
the clothes i'm wearing (i bought it)
the rock i'm rockin' (i bought it)
'cause i depend on me, if i want it

the watch i'm wearin' (i bought it)
the house i live in (i bought it)
the car i'm driving (i bought it)
(i depend on me) i depend on me

all the women who're independent
(throw your hands up at me)
all the honeys who makin' money
(throw your hands up at me)
all the mamas who profit dollars
(throw your hands up at me)
all the ladies who truly feel me
(throw your hands up at me)

girl, i didn't know you could get down like that
charlie, how your angels get down like that?
girl, i didn't know you could get down like that
charlie, how your angels get down like that?

tell me how you feel about this
do what i want, live how i wanna live
i worked hard and sacrificed to get what i get
ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent

question: how'd you like this knowledge that i brought?
braggin' on that cash that he gave you is a front
if you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
depend on no one else to give you what you want

the shoes on my feet (i bought it)
the clothes i'm wearing (i bought it)
the rock i'm rockin' (i bought it)
'cause i depend on me if i want it

the watch i'm wearin' (i bought it)
the house i live in (i bought it)
the car i'm driving (i bought it)
(i depend on me) i depend on me

all the women who are independent
(throw your hands up at me)
all the honeys who makin' money
(throw your hands up at me)
all the mamas who profit dollars
(throw your hands up at me)
all the ladies who truly feel me
(throw your hands up at me)

girl, i didn't know you could get down like that
charlie, how your angels get down like that?

independent beauty
no one else takes care of me
charlie's angels

whoa all the women who are independent
