i been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
i'm drunk and dirty, don't ya know
and i'm still, willin'
and i was out on the road, late at night
i see my pretty alice in every headlight
alice, dallas alice

i've been from tucson to tucumcari, tehachapi to tonapah
driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
driven the back roads, so i wouldn't get weighed
and if you give me ... weed, whites, and wine
and you show me a sign, i'll be willin'
to be movin'

well i've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
had my head stoved in, but i'm still on my feet
and i'm still, willin'

smuggled some smokes and folks from mexico
baked by the sun, every time i go to mexico
and i'm still

and i been from tuscon to tucumcari, tehachapi to tonapah
driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
driven the back roads, so i wouldn't get weighed
and if you give me ... weed, whites, and wine
and you show me a sign
i'll be willin'
to be movin'
