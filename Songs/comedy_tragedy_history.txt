dat boy akala's a diamond fella 
all you little boys are a comedy of errors 
you bellow but you fellows get played like 
the cello, i'm doing my ting 
you're jealous like othello. 
who you? what you gonna do? 
all you little boys get tamed like the shrew 
you're mid-summer dreamin' 
your tunes aren't appealing 
i'm capulet, you're montague, i ain't feeling 
i am the julius caesar hear me 
the merchant of venice couldn't sell your cd 
as for me, all's well that ends well 
your boy's like macbeth, you're going to hell 
measure for measure, i am the best here 
you're merry wives of windsor not king lear 
i don't know about timon 
i know he was in athens 
when i come back like hamlet you pay for your action

dat boy akala, i do it as you like 
you're much ado about nothing 
all you do is bite it 
i'm too tight, i don't need 12 knights 
all you little tempests get murked on the mic 
of course i'm the one with the force 
you're history like henry iv 
i'm fire, things look dire 
better run like pericles prince of tyre 
off the scale, cold as a winter's tale 
titus andronicus was bound to fail 
so will you if akala get at ya 
that's suicide like anthony &amp; cleopatra 
cymbeline was a modern day bridget jones 
love's labours lost, a woman on her own 
she needed two gentlemen of verona 
this is illa state and i am the owner

wise is the man that knows he's a fool 
tempt not a desperate man with a jewel 
why take from peter to go pay paul 
some rise by sin and by virtue fall 
what have you made if you gain the whole world 
but sell your own soul for the price of a pearl 
the world is my oyster and i am starving 
i want much more than a penny or a farthing 
i told no joke, i hope you're not laughing 
poet or pauper which do you class him 
speak eloquent, though i am resident to the gritty inner city 
that's surely irrelevant 
call it urban, call it street 
a rose by any other name, smell just as sweet 
spit so hard, but i'm smart as the bard 
come through with a union jack, full of yard

akala, akala, where for art thou? 
i am the black shakespearian 
the secret's out now 
chance never did crown me, this is destiny 
you still talk but it still perplexes me 
devour cowards, thousands per hour 
don't you know the king's name is a tower 
you should never speak it 
it is not a secret 
i teach thesis, like anicent greece's 
or egyptology, never no apology 
in my minds eye, i see things properly 
stopping me, nah you could never probably 
i bare a charmed life, most probably 
for certain i put daggers in a phrase 
i'll put an end to your dancing days 
no matter what you say it will never work 
wrens can't prey 
where eagles don't perch 
i'm the worst with th words 
cos i curse all my verbs 
i'm the first with a verse to rehearse with a nurse 
there's a hearse for the first jerk who turn berserk 
off with his head, cos it must not work 
ramp with akala, that's true madness 
and there's no method in it, just sadness 
i speak with daggers and the hammers 
of a passion when i'm rappin i attack 'em 
in a military fashion the pattern of my rappin 
chattin couldn't ever map it 
and i run more rings round things than saturn 
verses split big kids wigs when i'm rappin 
that boy akala, the black shakespeare 
did not want to listen, when i said last year 
rich like a gem in ethiope's ear 
tell them again 
for them who never hear
