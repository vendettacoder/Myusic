sprawling on the fringes of the city
in geometric order
an insulated border
in between the bright lights
and the far unlit unknown

growing up it all seems so one-sided
opinions all provided
the future pre-decided
detached and subdivided
in the mass production zone

nowhere is the dreamer
or the misfit so alone

(subdivisions)
in the high school halls
in the shopping malls
conform or be cast out
(subdivisions)
in the basement bars
in the backs of cars
be cool or be cast out

any escape might help to smooth
the unattractive truth
but the suburbs have no charms to soothe
the restless dreams of youth

drawn like moths we drift into the city
the timeless old attraction
cruising for the action
lit up like a firefly
just to feel the living night

some will sell their dreams for small desires
or lose the race to rats
get caught in ticking traps
and start to dream of somewhere
to relax their restless flight

somewhere out of a memory
of lighted streets on quiet nights

(subdivisions)
in the high school halls
in the shopping malls
conform or be cast out
(subdivisions)
in the basement bars
in the backs of cars
be cool or be cast out

any escape might help to smooth
the unattractive truth
but the suburbs have no charms to soothe
the restless dreams of youth
