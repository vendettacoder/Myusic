there's a destination a little up the road
from the habitations and the towns we know
a place we saw the lights turn low
the jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh flow
pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
two turntables and a microphone
bottles and cans and just clap your hands 
and just clap your hands

where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone

take me home with my elevator bones
that was a good drum break

pick yourself up off the side of the road
with your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones
members only, hypnotizers
move through the room like ambulance drivers
shine your shoes with your microphone blues
hirsutes with your parachute fruits
passing the dutchie from coast to coast
let the man gary wilson rock the most

where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone

what about those who swing both ways? ac-dc's?
let's make it out baby

two turntables and a microphone
two turntables and a microphone
two turntables and a microphone
two turntables and a microphone
two turntables and a microphone
two turntables and a microphone

we're all part of the total syndrome

where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone

oh, dear me, make out city is a two-horse town
that's beautiful, dad 
get my microphone

there's a destination a little up the road
from the habitations and the towns we know
a place we saw the lights turn low
jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
two turntables and a microphone
bottles and cans and just clap your hands 
and just clap your hands

where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
where it's at
i got two turntables and a microphone
