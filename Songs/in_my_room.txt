there's a world where
i can go and
tell my secrets to
in my room
in my room

in this world i
lock out all my
worries and my fears
in my room
in my room

do my dreaming and my scheming
lie awake and pray?
do my crying and my sighing
laugh at yesterday?

now it's dark and
i'm alone but
i won't be afraid
in my room
in my room

in my room, in my room
in my room, in my room
