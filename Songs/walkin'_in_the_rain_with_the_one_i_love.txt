it sure is
everyone's trying to get out in the rain
oh, it feels so good

the rain and thinking of you
soon as i get home, i'm gonna call you
and tell you, how much i love you
oh, i feel so good

oh, i just
walking in the rain with the one i love
feel so fine
walking in the rain with the one i love
on my mind

to each is own, i've heard them say
well, i got mine in so many ways, yeah
like being together, whether near or far
it doesn't matter where you are

so in love with each other
giving love so warm and free
made our dream a reality
then it'll last forever and ever

with every step we take
and every breath we make
darling, just you and me

oh, i just
walking in the rain with the one i love
feel so fine
walking in the rain with the one i love
on my mind

so in love with each other
with every passing day we share
the thought of knowing someone cares
just being together

making love so tenderly
exploding into ecstasy
then it'll last forever and ever
together we hold the key
to make forever our destiny

oh, i just
walking in the rain with the one i love
feel so fine
walking in the rain with the one i love
on my mind

i'm gonna call him right now
gee, i hope he's home
hello
baby, i'm home

i've got something to tell you
what?
i love you
oh, i love you too

did you get caught in the rain?
oh, yes
it was so beautiful
let me tell you how it started

walking in the rain with the one i love
