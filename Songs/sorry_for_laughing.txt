it took ten years to realise
why the angels start to cry
when you roll on down the lane
your happy smile, your funny name

i'm not being mean, so don't take it hard
when i ask you to run round the yard

it's so hopeless to define
why you jump to close the blinds
you know i'd help you if i could
but both my arms are made of wood

just don't mean the things i say
it's only 'cause you're made that way

sorry for laughing
there's too much happening
sorry for laughing
there's too much happening

when we groove on into town
charles atlas starts to frown
'cause he's not made like me and you
just can't do the things we do

you know it's times like these you have to pay
so sorry to turn on that way
