one month ago today
i was happy as a lark
but now i go for walks
to the movies, maybe to the park

and have a seat on the same old bench
to watch the children play, huh
you know, tomorrow is their future
but to me just another day

they all gather around me
they seem to know my name
we laugh, tell a few jokes
but it still doesn't ease my pain

well, i know i can't hide from a memory
'though day after day i've tried
i keep sayin' she'll be back
but today again i lied

oh, i see her face everywhere i go
on the street and even at the picture show
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

oh, i hear her voice as the cold winds blow
in the sweet music on my radio
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

why, oh why
did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
oh, i've been used to havin' someone to lean on
and i'm lost
baby, i'm lost

oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

oh, she left her kiss upon my lips
but left that break within my heart
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

oh, i see her hand reaching out to me
only she can set me free
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

why oh why?
did you have to leave and go away? oh yeah
ooh oh, i've been used to having someone to lean on
and i'm lost, baby i'm lost

oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?

as another day comes to an end
i'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
anything that she would send
with all the people i know
i'm still a lonely man
you know, it's funny
but i thought i had her in the palm of my hand

have you seen her
tell me, have you seen her (tell me, have you seen her?)

oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?
have you seen her?
tell me, have you seen her?
