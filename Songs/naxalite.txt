brothers and sisters of the soul unite
we are one indivisible and strong
they may try to break us but they dare not under estimate us
they know our memories are long
a mass of sleeping villages
that's how they're pitching it
at least that's what they try to pretend
but check out our history
so rich and revolutionary

a prophecy that we will rise again
again and again until the land is ours
again and again until we have taken the power
again and again until the land is ours
again and again until we have taken the power

deep in the forest
high up in the mountains
to the future we will take an oath
like springing tigers we encircle the cities
our home is the undergrowth
because i am just a naxalite warrior
fighting for survival and equality
police man beating up me, my brother and my father
my mother crying can't believe this reality

again and again until the land is ours
again and again until we have taken the power
again and again until the land is ours
again and again until we have taken the power

jump into the future dub zone
roots rockers

and we have taken the power
and the land is ours
and we have taken the power
and the land is ours
and we have taken the power
and the land is ours
and we have taken the power
and the land is ours

because i am just a naxalite warrior
fighting for survival and equality
police man beating up me, my brother and my father
my mother crying can't believe this reality

iron like a lion from zion
this one going all the youth, man and woman
orginal master d upon the microphone stand
cater for no skeptical man- me no give a damn
'cos me a naxalite warrior
