she lives in this house over there 
has her world outside it 
scrabbles in the earth with her fingers and her mouth 
she's five years old 

threads worms on a string 
keeps spiders in her pocket 
collects fly wings in a jar 
scrubs horse flies 
and pinches them on a line 
ohhh... 

she has one friend, he lives next door 
they're listening to the weather 
he knows how many freckles she's got 
she scratches his beard 

she's painting huge books 
and glues them together 
they saw a big raven 
it glided down the sky 
she touched it 
ohhh... 

today is a birthday 
they're smoking cigars 
he's got a chain of flowers 
and sews a bird in her knickers 
ohhh... 

they're smoking cigars 
they lie in the bathtub 
a chain of... flowers

tam, tam, tam-a-tam-a-tam...
