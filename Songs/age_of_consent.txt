won't you please let me go?
these words lie inside they hurt me so
and i'm not the kind that likes to tell you
just what i want to do
i'm not the kind that needs to tell you
just what you want me to

i saw you this morning
i thought that you might like to know
i received your message in full a few days ago
i understood every word that it said
and now that i've actually heard it
you're going to regret

and i'm not the kind that likes to tell you
just what you want me to
you're not the kind that needs to tell me
about the birds and the bees

do you find this happens all the time?
crucial point one day becomes a crime
and i'm not the kind that likes to tell you
just what i want to do
and i'm not the kind that needs to tell you

i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you

i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you

i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
i've lost you
