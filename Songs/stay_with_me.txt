in the mornin', don't say you love me
'cause i'll only kick you out of the door 
i know your name is rita 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter
since when i saw you down on the floor

won't need too much pursuadin'
i don't mean to sound degradin'
but with a face like that, you got nothin' to laugh about
red lips, hair and fingernails
i hear you're a mean old jezebel
let's go up stairs and read my tarot cards 

stay with me, stay with me 
for tonight you'd better stay with me
stay with me, stay with me 
for tonight you'd better stay with me 

so, in the mornin', please don't say you love me 
'cause you know i'll only kick you out the door 
yeah, i'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne
just don't be here in the mornin' when i wake up 

stay with me, stay with me 
for tonight you'd gonna stay with me
sit down, get up, get out
