they want to socialize you
they want to purify you
they want to dignify, analyze and terrorize you

this is love and you can't make it
in a formula or shake me
i'm your monster i'm not like you
all your life is written for you

(look out they want what you know
steal a kid break a heart steal the show
peel back the skin see what's there
i'll never show you what's in here)

you're life is good for one thing
you're messing with what's sacred
they want to simplify your needs and likes
to sterilize you

this is love and you can't make it
in a formula or break me
i'm your monster i'm just like you
all my life is right before you

(don't need you to explain the pain
i can prove to you it's all fake
she's dead but she can stand she can walk
call the doctor miracle she can talk)

call the doctor

this is love and you can't break it
in a formula or make me
i'm no monster i'm just like you
all my life is right before me

(this is not really me at all
stunt girl daring twirls watch me fall
carbon copy same body different hearts
can't tell anymore the real parts)
