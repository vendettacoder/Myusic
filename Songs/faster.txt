i hate purity. i hate goodness. i don't want virtue to exist anywhere. i want everyone corrupt.

i am an architect - they call me a butcher. i am a pioneer - they call me primitive
i am purity - they call me perverted. holding you but i only miss these things when they leave

i am idiot drug hive; the virgin; the tattered and the torn. life is for the cold made warm and they are just lizards
self-disgust is self-obsession, honey, and i do as i please. a morality obedient only to the cleansed repented

i am stronger than mensa, miller and mailer; i spat out plath and pinter
i am all the things that you regret. a truth that washes, that learnt how to spell

the first time you see yourself naked you cry. soft skin, now acne; foul breath; so broken
he loves me truly, this mute solitude i'm draining. i know i believe in nothing but it is my nothing

sleep can't hide the thoughts splitting through my mind. shadows aren't clean; false mirrors; too many people awake
if you stand up like a nail then you will be knocked down. i've been too honest with myself; i should have lied like everybody else
 
i am stronger than mensa, miller and mailer; i spat out plath and pinter
i am all the things that you regret. a truth that washes, that learnt how to spell

so damn easy to cave in. man kills everything. so damn easy to cave in. man kills everything
so damn easy to cave in. man kills everything. so damn easy to cave in. man kills everything
