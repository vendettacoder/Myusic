let's drink to the hard working people 
let's drink to the lowly of birth 
raise your glass to the good and the evil 
let's drink to the salt of the earth 

say a prayer for the common foot soldier 
spare a thought for his back breaking work 
say a prayer for his wife and his children 
who burn the fires and who still till the earth 

and when i search a faceless crowd 
a swirling mass of gray and black and white 
they don't look real to me 
in fact, they look so strange 

raise your glass to the hard working people 
let's drink to the uncounted heads 
let's think of the wavering millions 
who need leaders but get gamblers instead 

spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter 
his empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows 
and a parade of the gray suited grafters 
a choice of cancer or polio 

and when i look in the faceless crowd 
a swirling mass of grays and black and white 
they don't look real to me 
or don't they look so strange 

let's drink to the hard working people 
let's think of the lowly of birth 
spare a thought for the rag taggy people 
let's drink to the salt of the earth 

let's drink to the hard working people 
let's drink to the salt of the earth 
let's drink to the two thousand million 
let's think of the humble of birth

let's raise our drink
to the salt of the earth
let's raise our drink
to the salt of the earth...
