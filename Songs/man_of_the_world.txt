shall i tell you about my life
they say i'm a man of the world
i've flown across every tide
and i've seen lots of pretty girls

i guess i've got everything i need
i would't ask for more
and there's no one i'd rather be
but i just wish that i'd never been born

break:

     and i need a good woman
     to make me feel like a good man should
     i don't say i'm a good man
     oh, but i would be if i could

i could tell you about my life
and keep you amused i'm sure
about all the times i've cried
and how i don't want to be sad anymore
and how i wish i was in love
