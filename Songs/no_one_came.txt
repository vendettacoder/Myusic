maybe it's because i'm only starting
that i think it won't take too long
maybe it's because i can see you laughing
that i think you've got it wrong
maybe i could be like robin hood
like an outlaw dressed all in green
someone said what's he gonna turn out like
and someone else said never mind
well i was big and bold and more than twice as old
as all the cats i'd ever seen
i grew my hair and bought a suit
of shiny white or was it cream
i shook and shivered danced and quivered
and stood on a mountain top

no one came from miles around and said
man your music is really hot

well i knew what they meant because i was a freak
my throat was tired and worn
my pretty face just looked out of place
as they poured on the scorn
i wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
he said, "my boy, we'll have some crazy scenes"
there weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
he must've been the king of queens
well i could write a million songs about the things i've done
but i could never sing them so they'd never get sung
there's a law for the rich and one for the poor
and there's another one for singers
it's die young and live much longer
spend your money and sit and wonder

no one came for miles around
and said man your music is really funky

i believe that i must tell the truth
and say things as they really are
but if i told the truth and nothing but the truth
could i ever be a star?
nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'
everyone's shouting out loud
it's only the glitter and shine that gets through
where's my robin hood outfit?
well i've come and i've gone before you wink an eye
no one ever cared enough to say goodbye
the money's good and the time you have
fun and games galore
but you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
and you wonder what you did it for

no one came from miles around
and said man who's he?
