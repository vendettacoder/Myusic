drifting out of time
something on your mind
and i wanna be the 
one that you call
when you get down
no matter where you 
are in the world i'll be around

fly me away on an aeroplane
high in the sky
wanna see you again
wanna know this time,
gonna tell you what i'm feeling
gonna know this time,
gonna get it back that feeling

miles and miles of sun
endless roads
twist on
don't wanna live a life
in a world that's all the same
the crazy little things
that you do are magical

this crazy life
this crazy world
we're living in is
magical
