life is hard, and so am i
you'd better give me something, so i don't die
novocaine for the soul
before i sputter out
before i sputter out

life is white and i am black
jesus and his lawyer are coming back
oh my darling, will you be here
before i sputter out
before i sputter out
before i sputter out

guess who's living here, with the great undead
this paint-by-numbers life is fucking with my head
once again

life is good and i feel great
'cause mother says i was a great mistake
novocaine for the soul
you'd better give me something to fill the hole
before i sputter out
before i sputter out
before i sputter out
before i sputter out
before i sputter out
