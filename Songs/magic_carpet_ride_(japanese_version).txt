------------------------
it's strange but
you and i
have been friends
since forever
isn't it

don't you think 
it feels like
we've loved each other
for two thousand
light years?

and before
we realise
we'll
be old

(it's alright if)
we can go on
having so much fun
forever

magic carpet ride

it's like magic
when i wake up
there you are
it smells 
like flowers

let's cross
two thousand light years
once again
on a persian carpet

and before
we realise
we'll
be old

(it's alright if)
we can go on
having so much fun
forever

magic carpet ride

and someday
we will also
have 
kids

but (it's alright) if
we can go on
having fun forever

(it's alright) if
we can hug and die
on the same bed

magic carpet ride
