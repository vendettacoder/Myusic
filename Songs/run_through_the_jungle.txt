whoa, thought it was a nightmare,
lord, it's all so true.
they told me, "don't go walkin' slow,
'cause devil's on the loose."

better run through the jungle,
better run through the jungle,
better run through the jungle,
whoa, don't look back to see.

thought i heard a rumblin'
callin' to my name.
two hundred million guns are loaded,
satan cries, "take aim!"

better run through the jungle,
better run through the jungle,
better run through the jungle,
whoa, don't look back to see.

over on the mountain,
thunder magic spoke,
"let the people know my wisdom,
fill the land with smoke."

better run through the jungle,
better run through the jungle,
better run through the jungle,
whoa, don't look back to see.
