one, two, one, two, three

woooh, uh-yeah

two feets they come a-creepin
like a black cat do
and two bodies are layin' naked
creeper think he got nothin' to lose
so he creeps into this house, yeah
and unlocks the door
and as uh man's reaching for his trousers
shoots him full of thirty-eight holes

mr saturday night special
got a barrel that's blue and cold
they ain't good for nothin
but put a man six feet in a hole

big jim's been drinkin' whiskey
and playin' poker on a losin' night
and pretty soon ol' jim starts a thinkin'
somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
so big jim commence to fightin',
i wouldn't tell you no lie
big jim done-a pulled his pistol,
shot his friend right between the eyes

ooooh, here it come

oooo, let me tell you all about it

hand guns are made for killin',
they ain't no good for nothin' else.
and if you like to drink your whiskey
you might even shoot yourself.
so why don't we dump 'em people
to the bottom of the sea
before some ol' fool come around here,
wanna shoot either you or me.
