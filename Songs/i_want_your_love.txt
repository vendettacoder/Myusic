i want your love, i want your love
i want your love, i want your love

do you feel like you ever want
to try my love and see how well it fits?
baby, can't you see when you look at me
i can't kick this feeling when it hits?

all alone in my bed at night
i grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
i think of you and i dream of you
all of the time, what am i gonna do?

i want your love, i want your love
i want your love, i want your love

i want your love, i need your love
i'll share my dreams and make you see
how really bad your love i need

i want your love, i need your love
just like the birds the sky above
i'll share my dreams and make you see
how really bad your love i need

i want your love, i want your love
i want your love, i want your love
i want your love, i want your love
