she's in love with herself
she likes the dark
on her milk white neck
the devil's mark

now it's all hallows eve
the moon is full
will she trick or treat?
i bet she will
she will!
happy halloween - baby

she's got a date at midnight
with nosferatu
oh baby, lilly munster
ain't got nothing on you

well when i called her evil
she just laughed
well cast that spell on me
boo bitch craft

yeah you wanna go out cause it's raining and blowing
you can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
dye em black
dye em black

black, black, black, black no. 1
black, black, black, black no. 1

little wolf skin boots
and clove cigarettes
an erotic funeral
for which she's dressed
her perfume smells like
burning leaves
everyday is halloween

yeah you wanna go out cause it's raining and blowing
you can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
dye em black
dye em black

black, black, black, black no. 1
she dyes em black, black, black, black no. 1

loving you was like loving the dead
loving you was like loving the dead
loving you was like loving the dead

loving you was like loving the dead
