never give up, never give up, never give up the army 

join the army at seventeen
till you sware that you're a killing machine
three more rifles if they die
you got to do whatever the army says

army life is killing me, me, me
army life is killing me

went to belfast just for fucking fun
walking about with my tommy gun
sit on a landmine, you wake up dead
you'll just be anounced in your local paper

army life is killing me, me, me
army life is killing me ... guitar...

army life is killing me, me, me
army life is killing me

the file is up, just the end of the morning
i gotta get up outta bed to teach
they walk to the gathering full of hate
you gotta do whatever the army says

army life is killing me, me, me
army life is killing me

join the army to learn how to kill
join the army to be a man
for our words an they want yours
is gotta do whatever army says
