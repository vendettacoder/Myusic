i know she's a tracker, any scarlet would back her.
they say she's a chooser, but i just can't refuse her.
she was just there, but then she can't be here no more.
and as my mind unweaves, i feel the freeze down in my knees.
but just before she leaves, she receives.

she's been down in the dunes and she's dealt with the goons.
now she drinks from the bitter cup, i'm trying to get her to give it up.
she was just here, i fear she can't be here no more.
and as my mind unweaves, i feel the freeze down in my knees.
but just before she leaves, she receives.

it's long, long when she's gone, i get weary holding on.
now i'm coldly fading fast, i don't think i'm gonna last
very much longer.

"she's stoned" said the swede, and the moon calf agreed.
i'm like a viper in shock with my eyes in the clock.
she was just there somewhere and here i am again.
and as my mind unweaves, i feel the freeze down in my knees.
but just before she leaves, she receives.
