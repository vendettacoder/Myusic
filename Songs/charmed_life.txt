when i hold you in my arms
and look back on my charmed life
my charmed life
i hope, i hope if nothing more
that one day you'll call your life
a charmed life

well, i never really worried that much
about making lots of money and such
and i always seemed to land upon my feet
and though there's been some difficult times
the good times were never far behind
i snatched all of my victories from the jaws of defeat

when i hold you in my arms
and look back on my charmed life
my charmed life
i hope, dear
baby, i hope if nothing more
that one day you'll call your life
a charmed life

well, the course of true love never ran smooth
they broke my heart, and i broke theirs, too
and breaking up was so very hard to do
but i knew i'd find the one
and sure enough, she came along
and not long after that, along came you

well, sometimes this life is like being afloat 
on a raging sea in a little rowboat
just trying not to be washed overboard
but if you take your chances and you ride your luck
and you never, never, never, never, never give up
well, those waves will see you safely to a friendly shore

when i hold you in my arms
i know that this is a charmed life
a charmed life
