burn, burn
burn, burn

burn, burn, burn...

open up
now open up

you lied, you faked
you cheated, you changed the stakes
magnet toss that pie in the sky
unrehearsed, let the bubbles burst

all in all, a three-ring circus
of unity with parody
tragedy or comedy
probably publicity

open up, make room for me
now open up, make room for me

lose myself inside your schemes
go for the money, honey
not the screen
be a movie star, blah blah blah
go the whole hog
be bigger than god

burn hollywood burn, taking down tinseltown
burn hollywood burn, burn down to the ground
burn hollywood burn, burn hollywood burn
take down tinseltown, burn down to the ground

down, into the ground

burn, burn, burn
burn...
