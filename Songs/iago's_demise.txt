ophelia
cordelia
desdemona
and kate
my sweetness and beatrice
so precious your pain
i sing for your lovers
your heavenly fathers to be
your possible futures
your obvious endings defeat me
alma
badoura
dorothea
and jade
belphoebe is just like me
such perfect disdain
i sing for the daughters
the heavenly mothers to be
insanity's wanderings
ritual fatherings greet me
so carry me (there's no one to)
comfort me (there's no one to)
care for me (there's no one to)
capture me
ophelia (i dream of the daughters to be)
cordelia (the ritual fatherings)
desdemona (the heavenly mothers to be)
and kate (insanity's wanderings)
alma (the sons and the lovers to be)
badoura (the infidel creatures like me)
dorothea (the virginal martyrs to be)
and jade (the doting fathers)
i sing for the passive
the heavenly loyals to be
the unrewarded loves
obvious endings defeat me
while i'm asleep i can open my eyes
what my lucid heart speaks
conscious caution denies
here betwixt and between
lies iago's demise
as i sing for my creatures
their infidel features
ophelia (i dream of the fathers to be)
cordelia (the heavenly loyals like me)
desdemona (insanity's wanderings)
and kate (suicide's followers)
my sweetness (the virginal martyrs to be)
and beatrice (the doting lovers for she)
so precious (the unrewarded like me)
your pain (the infidel creatures)
alma (the worshipful followers)
badoura (the doting mothers to be)
dorothea (the constant martyrs)
and jade (the unaging fathers)
belphoebe (the unloving characters)
is just like me (insanity's wanderings)
such perfect (the heavenly daughters to be)
disdain (the obvious endings)
