you wanna know if i know where
i can't say that i do
don't understand the evil and
or how one becomes two
i just can't recall what started it all
or how to begin the end
i ain't here to break it
just see how far it will bend
again and again, again and again

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
(again and again and again)

i wanna make it
i wanna make it witchu
(anytime, anywhere)

sometimes the same is different
but mostly it's the same
these mysteries of life
that just ain't my thang
if i told you that i knew about the sun and the moon
i'd be untrue
the only thing i know for sure
is what i won't do
anytime, anywhere

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
(again and again, yeah yeah)

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
(again and again)

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
(you)

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
(anytime, anywhere)

i wanna make it
i wanna make it wit chu
again and again and again and again and again)

i wanna make it
