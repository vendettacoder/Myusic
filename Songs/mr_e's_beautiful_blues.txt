the smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
the load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
the elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
the ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage

uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh

the girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
she's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
come on

uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh

the clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
finger on the trigger, let me tell you, it is quite a scare

uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh

the kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
my neighbor digs the flavor, still he's moving to another town
and i don't believe he'll come back

goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh

and i don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
you don't believe anyone, but most of all, don't believe me
only you

goddamn right, it's a beautiful day (only you)
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
uh-huh
