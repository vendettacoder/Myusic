juniko sent us electronic mail from japan

in september

she said that the moon was getting bigger there

that the typhoons had passed

and now it was time for moon-watching in japan

she brought us a cloth rabbit, in a clear box

and wrote on the card that they have a legend in japan:

that the rabbit in the moon bakes rice cakes

when the moon gets bigger

in september

she told us to sit the cloth rabbit by the window

and to watch the moon from there at night

but the moon didn't get any bigger here

in september
