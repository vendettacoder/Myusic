he's on the phone and she wants to go home
shoes in hand, don't make a sound, it's time to go
ooh-ooh, someday (someday), someday 

he's on the phone, doesn't want to go home
the hotel life, forget your wife, you're on your own
academia girl, her life's a gas, she loves the trash inside his world
can't find his way there, got the cash, feeling flash in leicester square, ooh

yes, she never meant to call, she did anyway
and now he's trying to find the words to say
someday (someday), someday (someday)
yes, she never meant to call, she did anyway
and now he's trying to find the words to say
someday (someday), someday (someday)

it's five to twelve and she's nervous as hell
with nothing to lose, it's hard to choose, it's hard to tell
skin is dewdrop and warm
the lipstick kiss, reminisce, awake 'til dawn, ooh

yes, she never meant to call, she did anyway
and now he's trying to find the words to say
someday (someday), someday (someday)
yes, she never meant to call, she did anyway
and now he's trying to find the words to say
someday (someday), someday (someday)

et c'est alors que supposement blesse par le commun des mortels
je resurrecte encore et encore, je resurrecte encore et encore

he's on the phone and she wants to go home
shoes in hand, don't make a sound, it's time to go

yes, she never meant to call, she did anyway
and now he's trying to find the words to say
someday (someday), someday (someday)
yes, she never meant to call, she did anyway
and now he's trying to find the words to say
someday (someday), someday (someday), someday
