all i want is a room with a view
a sight worth seeing, a vision of you
all i want is a room with a view

i will give you my finest hour
the one i spent watching you shower
i will give you my finest hour

all i want is a photo in my wallet
a small rememberance of something more solid
all i want is a picture of you

picture this - a day in december
picture this - feezing cold weather
you got clouds on your lids 
and you'd be on the skids 
if it weren't for your job at the garage
if you could only
picture this - a sky full of thunder
picture this - my telephone number
one and one is what i'm telling you

all i want is 20-20 vision
a total portrait with no omissions
all i want is a vision of you

if you can
picture this - a day in december
picture this - feezing cold weather
you got clouds on your lids 
and you'd be on the skids 
if it weren't for your job at the garage
if you could only
picture this - a sky full of thunder
picture this - my telephone number
one and one is what i'm telling you
get a pocket computer
try to do what ya used to do
