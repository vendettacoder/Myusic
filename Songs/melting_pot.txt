take a pinch of white man
wrap it up in black skin
add a touch of blue blood
and a little bitty bit of red indian boy
ooh curly latin kinkies
mixed with yellow chinkies
if you lump it all together
well you got a recipe for a get along scene
oh what a beautiful dream
if it could only come true, you know, you know

chorus

what we need is a great big melting pot
big enough to take the world and all its got 
and keep it stirring for a hundred years or more
and turn out coffee coloured people by the score

yeah lord

rabbis and the friars
bishops and the gurus
you got the beatles or the sun god (it's true)
well it really doesn't matter what religion you choose
no no no ooh
mick and lady faithful
ohh and mrs. graceful
you know that livin' could be tasteful
aaah we should all get together in a loving machine
i better call up the queen
it' s only fair that she knows, you know, you know

what we need is a great big melting pot
big enough to take the world and all its got 
and keep it stirring for a hundred years or more
and turn out coffee coloured people by the score

repeat chorus to fade
