set fire to your head
poke a stick at a grizzly bear
eat medicine that's out of date
use your private parts as piranha bait

dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die
dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die

get your toast out with a fork
do your own electrical work
teach yourself how to fly
eat a two week old unrefrigerated pie

dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die
dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die

invite a psycho killer inside
scratch a drug dealer's brand new ride
take your helmet off in outer space
use a clothes dryer as a hiding place

dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die
dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die

keep a rattlesnake as a pet
sell both your kidneys on the internet
eat a tube of superglue
i wonder what's this red button do?

dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die
dumb ways to die
so many dumb ways to die

dress up like a moose during hunting season
disturb a nest of wasps for no good reason

stand on the edge of train station platform
drive around the boomgates at level crossing
run across the tracks between the platforms
they may not rhyme but they're quite possibly

the dumbest ways to die
the dumbest ways to die
the dumbest ways to die
so many dumb
so many dumb ways to die
