just sitting down by the riverside
spreading my arms to the open wide
now i am free and the world's at my feet
i can close my eyes

oh love, keep me warm, keep me satisfied
please keep me calm, keep me pacified
now i'm content and my life is complete
i can close my eyes

sitting by the riverside with you

i love sitting down by the riverside
watching the water go flowing by
oh golly gee, it is heaven to be
like a willow tree

spend my time just drinking wine while looking at the view
