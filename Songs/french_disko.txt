though this world's essentially 
an absurd place to be living in
it doesn't call for total withdrawal

i've been told it's a fact of life

an absurd place to be living in
it doesn't call for bubble withdrawal

it's said human existence is pointless 
as acts of rebellious solidarity 
can bring sense in this world
