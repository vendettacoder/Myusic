"backside melts into a sofa. my world, my tv, and my food. besides listening to my belly gurgle, ain't much else to do. yeah, i sweat a lot. pants fall down every time i bend over, and my feet itch. yeah i married a scarecrow." 

i hate you 
talking to myself 
everybody's starin' at me 
i'm only bleedin' 

"someone taps me on the shoulder every five minutes. nobody speaks english anymore. would anybody tell me if i was gettin' stupider?" 

i hate you 
talking to myself 
you don't feel it after a while 
you take the beating 

i'm a swingin' guy
throw a belt over the shower curtain rod and swing
toss me inside a hefty
and put me in the ground

"a drink needs me, i don't... i ain't about to guzzle no tears, so kiss my ass. newscasters and cockroaches and desserts." 

i hate you
talkin' to myself
everybody's starin' at me
i'm only bleedin'

"where are the kids? i don't know... maybe pregnant, or on drugs, or on welfare, on top of the world, honor role on parole dodgers, on the backs of milk cartons, on stakes in the middle of cornfields, on the covers of future history books, on old ladies' mantles, walkin' on water nailed on crosses ... i think it's time i had a talk with my kids. i'll just tell 'em what my daddy told me ... you ain't never going to amount to nothin'."
