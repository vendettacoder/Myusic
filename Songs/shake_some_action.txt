i will find a way
to get to you some day
oh, but i, babe, i'm so afraid i'll fall, yeah
now can't you hear me call?

shake some action's what i need
to let me bust out at full speed
i'm sure that's all you need
to make it all right

it's taken me so long
to get where i belong
oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah
for i will make you pay

shake some action's what i need
to let me bust out at full speed
i'm sure that's all you need
to make it all right

if you don't dig what i say
then i will go away
and i won't come back this again, no
'cause i don't need a friend

shake some action's what i need
to let me bust out at full speed
i'm sure that's all you need
to make it all right
