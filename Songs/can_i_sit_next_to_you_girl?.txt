i met this girl for the first time on saturday night
standing in the queue at the odeon alright
then i took her by surprise
when i threw her one of my lines
she started smiling and being real fine
that's when i say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

can i sit next to you, girl?

at intermission we were doing alright
until this guy came up and stood by her side
then he took me by surprise
when he threw her one of my lines
she started smiling at him real fine
that's when he say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

can i sit next to you, girl?
