used to be a cop, but i got to be too jumpy.
i used to like to party till i coughed up half a lung.
sometimes late at night i hear the beat a-bumping
i reach for my holster and i wake up all alone.

used to have a wife but she told me i was crazy.
said she couldn't stand the way i fidget all the time.
sometimes late at night i circle round the house.
i look through the windows and i dream that she's still mine.

i got scars on my back from the way my daddy raised me.
i used to have a family until i got divorced.
i've gone too far from the things that could save me.
i used to be a cop, but they kicked me off the force.
i used to be a cop, till they kicked me off the force.

used to have a car, but the bank came and took it.
paying for a house that that bitch lives in now.
children that we had won't even look at me.
guess there's nothing left to lose, nothing matters anyhow.

got a scar on my arm from the bullet that once grazed me.
i keep it in a box to remind me where i've been.
that thin blue line was the only thing that could save me.
i used to have a badge but they made me turn it in.

and i used to play football, but i wasn't big enough for college.
but i passed the entrance exam first try, and on my way.
police academy gave me the only thing i was ever good at,
but my temper and the shakes, and they took that thing away.

used to have a wife, but she just couldn't deal
with the anger and the tension that was welling inside of me.
sometimes late at night, i circle round the house
i look through the window and i remember how it used to be.
