don't believe me if i tell you
not a word of this is true
don't believe me if i tell you
especially if i tell you
i'm in love with you

don't believe me if i tell you
that i wrote this song for you
there might be some other silly pretty girl
i'm singing it to

don't believe a word
for words are so easily spoken
your heart is like a promise
made to be broken

don't believe a word
'cause words can tell lies
and lies are no company
when there's tears in your eyes

don't believe me if i tell you
not a word of this is true
don't believe me if i tell you
especially if i tell you
that i'm in love with you

don't believe a word
no, don't believe a word
don't believe me
don't believe me
not a single word
