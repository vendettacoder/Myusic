i see you from the sky
and i wonder how long it'll take me to get home
i wait for an hour or so at the carousel
i have a cigarette to pass the time
'cause the traffic's hell

ahhh, i don't want anything more 
than to see your face when you open the door
you'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
and we'll get a chinese and watch tv
tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk 
and in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talk
i'll be exhausted so i'll probably sleep
and we'll get a chinese and watch tv

you wipe the tears from my eye
and you say that all that it takes is a phone call
i cry at the thought of being alone and then
i wonder how long it'll take 'til i'm home again

ahhh, i don't want anything more 
than to see your face when you open the door
you'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
and we'll get a chinese and watch tv
tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk 
and in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talk
i'll be exhausted so i'll probably sleep
and we'll get a chinese and watch tv

i know it doesn't seem so fair
but i'll send you a postcard when i get there

i don't want anything more 
than to see your face when you open the door
you'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
and we'll get a chinese and watch tv
tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk 
and in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talk
i'll be exhausted so i'll probably sleep
and we'll get a chinese and watch tv
