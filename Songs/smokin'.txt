i've got pennies in my pocket
and i'm feeling okay
gonna find all my answers
with minimum delay

gonna manage my time
just like johann cruyff
if we do it together
we've got meaning of life

but i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it

the feeling's good
the time is now
so throw the knife
towards the meaning of life

coz i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it

no-one told us we could get so high (x4)

what's the meaning of life?
(a loving companion)
what's the meaning of life?
(stereo system)
what's the meaning of life?
(ten-speed mountain bike)
what's the meaning of life?
anything you like, like!

but i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
i just wanna smoke it
