i, i went to hell, i might as well learn by my mistakes
i at twenty-four, was insecure, do whatever it takes

come on and wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
it's time, smell the coffee, the coffee
wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
this time smell the coffee, the coffee

she's only got one reason to live
this is your life
she's only got one message to give
give it tonight

she's so gorgeous, i'll do anything
she's so gorgeous, i'll lose everything

any day!

come on and wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
it's time, smell the coffee, the coffee

wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
it's time, smell the coffee, the coffee

she's only got one reason to live
this is your life
she's only got one message to give
give it tonight

she's so gorgeous, i'll do anything
she's so gorgeous, i'll lose everything

she's so gorgeous, i'll do anything
she's so gorgeous, i'll lose everything

everyday!
