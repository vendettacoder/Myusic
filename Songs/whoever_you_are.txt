whoever you are 
i'm looking for you
on street after street, in bar after bar
the search for love is never ending
whoever you are

wherever you are 
i'm prepared to travel
no matter how long no matter how far
now it may be eternity before i see you
whoever you are

and while i search for you
i'll leave my door ajar

whoever you are 
you may well be weary
from dragging your feet round this little star
but don't despair one step you're there
you have to meet me

whoever you are
