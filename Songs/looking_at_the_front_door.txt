we fight every night now that's not kosher
i reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
and wake up to be greeted by an argument again
you act like you're ten
so immature i try to concentrate on a cure
and keep lookin' at the front door
thinkin' if i were to evacuate
you'd probably be straighter than straight and wouldn't have so much hate
'cause you don't know the pain i feel when i see you smilin'
and when i roll up you start wilin'
so i front like everything's hunky-dory
but it's a whole different story
you don't like the fact that i'm me
i don't put on a show when it comes time for you to have company
and your friends don't understand your choice of man
they speak proper while my speech is from a gargabe can
but regardless, you shouldn't have to be so raw
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
baby, i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door

and when you're with your friends, i glide to the side
until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
but when they're not around, the fights commence
i'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
'cause i'm the one that you claim to love for life
but all i get is gray hairs and strife
and i can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
and get foul every time you lose control
but that's not my order of operations
so i should win an award for lots of patience
'cause that's all a fella can have
with a girl who's shootin' up his world like shaft
and i don't think that i can take it anymore
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door

my friends always tell me how i'm lucky to possess
the best looking girl in the whole u.s.
but every time you scream, you blow your finesse
tryin' to dis the profess-
or twenty-four hours of acting sore
sometimes i wish you'd come down with lockjaw
so i don't have to take in the breakin'
you treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
it seems like just two years
back when we were bonded and not pierced
but now i keep itchin' to jet
sitting' in the chair just to stare, set
to sprint
yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
i say it now like i said it before
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door
