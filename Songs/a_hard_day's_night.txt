it's been a hard day's night
and i've been working like a dog
it's been a hard day's night
i should be sleeping like a log

but when i get home to you
i find the things that you do
will make me feel all right

you know i work all day
to get you money to buy you things
and it's worth it just to hear you say
you're gonna give me everything

so why on earth should i moan?
'cause when i get you alone
you know i'll feel okay

when i'm home
everything seems to be right
when i'm home
feeling you holding me tight
tight, yeah

it's been a hard day's night
and i've been working like a dog
it's been a hard day's night
i should be sleeping like a log

but when i get home to you
i find the things that you do
will make me feel all right
ow!

so why on earth should i moan?
'cause when i get you alone
you know i feel okay

when i'm home
everything seems to be right
when i'm home
feeling you holding me tight
tight, yeah

ooh, it's been a hard day's night
and i've been working like a dog
it's been a hard day's night
i should be sleeping like a log

but when i get home to you
i find the things that you do
will make me feel all right
you know, i feel all right
you know, i feel all right
