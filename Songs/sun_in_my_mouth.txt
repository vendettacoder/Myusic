i will wade out
till my thighs
are steeped
in burning flowers

i will take the sun in my mouth
and leap into
the ripe air
alive: with closed eyes

to dash
against darkness

in the sleeping curves
of my body

i shall enter
fingers
of smooth mastery

with chasteness
of sea-girls
will i complete the mystery
of my flesh
will i
complete
the mystery
of my flesh
my flesh

la la la la la la la la la la la la la
