one banana, two banana, three banana, four
four bananas make a bunch and so do many more. 
over hill and highway the banana buggies go
comin'on to bring you the banana splits show 

(chorus):
makin' up a mess of fun, 
makin' up a mess of fun
lots of fun for everyone
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 

four banana, three banana, two banana, one 
all bananas playin' in the bright warm sun.
flippin' like a pancake, popping like a cork 
fleegle, bingo, drooper an' snork

(repeat chorus)

two banana, four banana, one banana, three
swingin' like a bunch on monkeys, hangin' from a tree. 
hey there, ev'rybody, won't you come along and see
how much like banana splits ev'ryone can be 

makin' up a mess of fun, 
makin' up a mess of fun
lots of fun for everyone
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la 
tra la la, la la la la
