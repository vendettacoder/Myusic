(michael timmins)

the money would be pretty good
if a quart of milk were still a dollar
or even if a quart of milk were still a quart
and the hours, well, i don't mind
how they creep on by like an old love of mine
it's the years that simply disappear that are doing me in

guess i married too young,
yeah, nineteen was just too young,
but sometimes you meet someone
and your guts just burn
it's not that i don't love him anymore
it's just that when i hear him
coming through that front door
my heart doesn't race like it did once before

but i've got a horse out in the country
i get to see him every second sunday
he comes when i call him,
yeah, he knows his name
one day i'll saddle up
and the two of us will ride away

this weather i could almost stand
if the sun would shine a little brighter
or even if the sun would shine at all
but lately it just seems to me
that this life has lost its mystery
and these cold fall mornings seem to bite
just a little bit harder

and all my friends have settled down
become their mothers and their fathers
without a sound
except for cathy,
she bought a one-way subway ticket
and left us all behind

but i've got a horse out in the country
i get to see him every second sunday
he comes when i call him,
yeah, he knows his name
one day i'll saddle up
and the two of us will ride away

this town wouldn't be so bad
if a girl could trust her instincts
or even if a girl could trust a boy
