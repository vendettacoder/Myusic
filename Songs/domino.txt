well there's a cat in town that you might know,
he goes by the name of domino!
long key chain and a diamond ring,
(?), he's a crazy thing!
oh, they love him so! and there goes domino!
domino,domino, oh!
well the girls all think he's a real gone guy and they all flip when he walks by!
dandy clothes and big white shoes,
ready to go, never sings the blues!
they love him so! and there goes domino!
domino,domino, woah!
a gold (?) cap, and a solid style! long side burns and a crazy smile!
just ask they kids and they'll tell you so
(?) and there goes domino!
well they love him so! and there goes domino!
domino,domino, oh!
domino, domino, they love him so!
here comes domino, domino, domino...
domino! go man, go! domino, they love him so!
get out of the way! here comes domino!
domino,domino.....


(?) the blues boys call
(?) his flow back hair
(?) they dig that cat called domino
