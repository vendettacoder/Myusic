a young cowboy named billy joe grew restless on the farm
a boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
he changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair down
and his mother cried as he walked out

don't take your guns to town son 
leave your guns at home bill
don't take your guns to town

he laughed and kissed his mom and said, "your billy joe's a man"
i can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
but i wouldn't shoot without a cause; i'd gun nobody down"
but she cried again as he rode away

don't take your guns to town son 
leave your guns at home bill
don't take your guns to town

he sang a song as on he rode his guns hung at his hips
he rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lips
he stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
but his mother's words echoed again

don't take your guns to town son 
leave your guns at home bill
don't take your guns to town

he drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
and tried to tell himself he had become a man
a dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
and he heard again his mothers words

don't take your guns to town son 
leave your guns at home bill
don't take your guns to town

filled with rage then billy joe reached for his gun to draw
but the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw
as billy joe fell to the floor, the crowd all gathered 'round 
and wondered at his final words

don't take your guns to town son 
leave your guns at home bill
don't take your guns to town
