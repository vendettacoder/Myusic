i know what you think
it's clear as mud in your eyes
we're the plastic posers and prostitutes
you've obviously come to despise

you don't know nothing
you're not hot enough to matter
you don't understand the glamourous life
the dream that no one can shatter

we're shameless
we will do anything
to get our fifteen minutes of fame
we have no integrity
we're ready to crawl
to obtain celebrity
we'll do anything at all

i'm ambitious
believe me i'm going to be big
i'm a slave to glamour
applause and clamour
my makeup, my wardrobe, my wigs

don't call me pathetic
i'm hotter than you'll ever guess
i'm relentlessly tough, for when the going gets rough
the tough get their picture in the press

we're shameless
we will do anything
to get our fifteen minutes of fame
we have no integrity
we're ready to crawl
to obtain celebrity
we'll do anything at all

anything, anything, anything at all
we'll do anything, anything, anything at all
we'll do anything, anything, anything at all
we'll do anything, anything, anything at all

tell me you love me
admit it you're really impressed
would it not amuse you for me to seduce you
have you ever seen me undressed?

we're shameless
we will do anything
to get our fifteen minutes of fame
we have no integrity
we're ready to crawl
to obtain celebrity
we'll do anything at all

we're shameless
we will do anything
to get our fifteen minutes of fame (give me fifteen minutes)
we have no integrity
we're ready to crawl
to obtain celebrity
we'll do anything with anyone
go absolutely anywhere
for anything at all
