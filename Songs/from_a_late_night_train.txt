from a late night train
reflected in the water
when all the rainy pavement
lead to you
it's over now
i know it's over
but i can't let go

the cigarettes, the magazines
all stacked up in the rain
there doesn't seem to be a funny side
it's over now
i know it's over
but i can't let go

from a late night train
the little towns go rolling by
and people in the station
going home
it's over now
i know it's over
but i love you so
