you only see what your eyes want to see
how can life be what you want it to be
you're frozen... when your heart's not open

you're so consumed with how much you get
you waste your time with hate and regret
you're broken... when your heart's not open

mmm... mmm... mmm... if i could melt your heart
mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key

now there's no point in placing the blame
and you should know i'd suffer the same
if i lose you... my heart will be broken

love is a bird... she needs to fly
let all the hurt inside of you die
you're frozen... when your heart's not open

mmm... mmm... mmm... if i could melt your heart
mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key

you only see what your eyes want to see
how can life be what you want it to be
you're frozen... when your heart's not open

mmm... mmm... mmm... if i could melt your heart
mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key
if i could melt your heart

mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key
if i could melt your heart
