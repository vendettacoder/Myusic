king went a-runnin' after deer
wasn't scared of jumpin' off the truck in high gear
king went a-sniffin' and he would go
was the best old hound dog i ever did know.

i had a dog and his name was king
i told the dog about everything
there in my truck the dog and i
then one day the king up and died.

then i thought about the times we had
once when i kicked him when he was bad
old king sure meant a lot to me
but that hound dog is history.

that old king was a friend of mine
never knew a dog  that was half as fine
i may find one, you never do know
