yeah - well - i say what i mean
i say what comes to my mind
because i never get around to things
i live a straight - straight line

you know me - i'm acting dumb
you know the scene - very humdrum
boredom - boredom

i'm living in this movie
but it doesn't move me
i'm the man that's waiting for the phone to ring
hear it ring-a-ding-a-fucking-ding

you know me ...

you see there's nothing behind me
i'm already a has-been
because my future ain't what it was
well i think i know the words that i mean

you know me ...

b'dum - b'dum

i've taken this extravagant journey
so it seems to me
i just came from nowhere
and i'm going straight back there

you know me ...

so i'm living in this movie
but it doesn't move me
so tell me who are you trying to arouse?
get your hands out of my trousers

you know me ...
