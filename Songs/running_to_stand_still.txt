and so she woke up
woke up from where she was lyin' still.
said i gotta do something
about where we're goin'.

step on a steam train
step out of the driving rain, maybe
run from the darkness in the night.
singing ah, ah la la la de day
ah la la la de day.

sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth.
i see seven towers, but i only see one way out.
you gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
scream without raising your voice.
you know i took the poison, from the poison stream
then i floated out of here, singing
ah la la la de day
ah la la la de day.

she walks through the streets
with her eyes painted red
under black belly of cloud in the rain.
in through a doorway
she brings me white golden pearls
stolen from the sea.

she is ragin'
she is ragin'
and the storm blows up in her eyes.
she will suffer the needle chill
she's running to stand still.
