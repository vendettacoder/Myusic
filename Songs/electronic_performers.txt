we are the syncronizers
send messages through time code
midi clock rings in my mind
machines gave me some freedom
synthesizers gave me some wings
they drop me through twelve bit samplers
we are electronic performers
we are electronics 

we need to use envelope filters
to say how we feel
riding on magnetic waves
we search new programs for your pleasure
i want to patch my soul on your brain
bpm controls yoour heartbeats
we are the syncronizers
we are electronic performers
