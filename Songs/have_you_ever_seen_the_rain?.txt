someone told me long ago
there's a calm before the storm
i know
it's been comin' for some time

when it's over, so they say
it'll rain a sunny day
i know
shinin' down like water

i wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
i wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
comin' down on a sunny day

yesterday and days before
sun is cold and rain is hard
i know
been that play for all my time

till forever upon it goes
through the circle fast and slow
i know
it can't stop, i wonder

i wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
i wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
comin' down on a sunny day

yeah

i wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
i wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
comin' down on a sunny day
