i had to fix a lot of things this morning
'cause they were so scrambled
but now it's okay
i tell you i've got enough to do

the afternoon was filled up with phone calls
what a hot sticky day
yeah yeah yeah
the air is cooling down

take all the time you need
it's a lovely night
if you decide to come
you're gonna do it right

drive for a couple miles
you'll see a sign and turn
left for a couple blocks
next is mine, you'll turn

left on a little road
it's a bumpy one
you'll see a white fence
move the gate and drive

through on the left side
come right in and you'll
find me in my house somewhere
keeping busy while i wait

i get a lot of thoughts in the morning
i write 'em all down
if it wasn't for that
i'd forget 'em in a while

and lately i've been thinking 'bout a good friend
i'd like to see more of
yeah yeah yeah
i think i'll make a call

i wrote a number down
but i lost it so i 
searched through my pocket book
i couldn't find it so

i sat and concentrated 
on the number and
slowly it came to me
so i dialed it

and i let it ring a few times
there was no answer
so i let it ring a little more
still no answer

so i hung up the telephone
got some paper and
sharpened up a pencil and
wrote a letter to my friend
