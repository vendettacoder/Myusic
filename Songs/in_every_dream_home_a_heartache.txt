in every dream home a heartache
and every step i take
takes me further from heaven
is there a heaven?
i'd like to think so

standards of living
they're rising daily
but home, oh sweet home
it's only a saying
from bell push to faucet
in smart town apartment
the cottage is pretty
the main house a palace

penthouse perfection
but what goes on?
what to do there?
better pray there

open plan living
bungalow ranch-style
all of its comforts
seem so essential
i bought you mail order
my plain wrapper baby
your skin is like vinyl
the perfect companion

you float in my new pool
deluxe and delightful
inflatable doll
my role is to serve you
disposable darling
can't throw you away now
immortal and life-size
my breath is inside you

i'll dress you up daily
and keep you 'til death sighs
inflatable doll
lover ungrateful
i blew up your body
but you blew my mind

oh, those heartaches
dream home heartaches
oh, those heartaches
dream home heartaches
oh, those heartaches
dream home heartaches
