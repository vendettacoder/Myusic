she was a girl from birmingham
she just had an abortion
she was a case of insanity
her name was pauline she lived in a tree
she was a no one who killed her baby
she sent the letters from the country
she was an animal
she was a bloody disgrace!

body
i'm not an animal
body
i'm not an animal

dragged on a table in a factory
illegitimate place to be
in a packet in the lavatory
die little baby screaming

body
screamin fucking bloody mess
it's not an animal
it's an abortion

body, i'm not an animal
mummy, mummy, mummy i'm not an abortion

throbbing squirm 
gurgling bloody mess
i'm not a discharge
i'm not a nurseing protein
i'm not a throbbing squirm

i don't wanna baby that looks like that

body
