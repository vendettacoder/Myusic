well, come on all of you, big strong men,
uncle sam needs your help again.
he's got himself in a terrible jam
way down yonder in vietnam
so put down your books and pick up a gun,
we're gonna have a whole lotta fun.

and it's one, two, three,
what are we fighting for?
don't ask me, i don't give a damn,
next stop is vietnam;
and it's five, six, seven,
open up the pearly gates,
well there ain't no time to wonder why,
whoopee! we're all gonna die.

well, come on generals, let's move fast;
your big chance has come at last.
now you can go out and get those reds
'cause the only good commie is the one that's dead
and you know that peace can only be won
when we've blown 'em all to kingdom come.

and it's one, two, three,
what are we fighting for?
don't ask me, i don't give a damn,
next stop is vietnam;
and it's five, six, seven,
open up the pearly gates,
well there ain't no time to wonder why
whoopee! we're all gonna die.

come on wall street, don't be slow,
why man, this is war au-go-go
there's plenty good money to be made
by supplying the army with the tools of its trade,
but just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,
they drop it on the viet cong.

and it's one, two, three,
what are we fighting for?
don't ask me, i don't give a damn,
next stop is vietnam.
and it's five, six, seven,
open up the pearly gates,
well there ain't no time to wonder why
whoopee! we're all gonna die.

come on mothers throughout the land,
pack your boys off to vietnam.
come on fathers, and don't hesitate
to send your sons off before it's too late.
and you can be the first ones in your block
to have your boy come home in a box.

and it's one, two, three
what are we fighting for?
don't ask me, i don't give a damn,
next stop is vietnam.
and it's five, six, seven,
open up the pearly gates,
well there ain't no time to wonder why,
whoopee! we're all gonna die.
