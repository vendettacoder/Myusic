by far the worst is the hamburger lady
we must heal them for the qualified technicians
worse
alternating nights are automatic
she's lying there
hamburger lady
hamburger lady
she's dying, she is burned from the waist up, she is burned from the waste up
on her arm
her ear is burned, her eyelashes are burned, she can't hold anything
and even with medical advances, there's no end in sight
for hamburger lady
she wants me to tell you of her claim mind, from which the double play laying
the propping chair
leave her
she's burned from the waist down
that's what keeps her alive, the tubes
and the nice nurses
hamburger lady
hamburger lady
she's okay if you change the tubes
tubes in her legs, the tubes in her arms
she's okay
then it came out and saw the burn net
indeed in the account of killing
and it flashed on the carpet, it flashed on the floor
the hamburger lady
she came to rest
because of the burn she needs to kneel down
the qualified technicians
hamburger lady
hamburger lady
[...]
the propping chair
qualified technicians
keeps her alive
