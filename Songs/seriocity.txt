i used to be so sure
i used to be so certain
now it's gone
always needing more
bleating out excuses
i have none, none

cast reflections on the water
now that the deed is done
we'll wait
and watch the ripples fade away
hearts are breaking
someone's daughter
joins with someone's son
it goes on and on again
on and on again
we watch the ripples run

i used to be so sure
i used to be so certain
how could i be so wrong
always needing more
at last the chains are breaking
watch me now
watch me run

over fields and past the houses
like a bullet from the gun
watch the figure fade away
hearts are breaking
someone's daughter
joins with someone's son
all alone again, all alone again
watch the ripples run

over fields and past the houses
watch the rabbit run
