words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
they slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe 
pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, 
possessing and caressing me. 
jai guru de va om 

nothing's gonna change my world 
nothing's gonna change my world. 
nothing's gonna change my world 
nothing's gonna change my world. 

images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, 
that call me on and on across the universe, 
thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they 
tumble blindly as they make their way 
across the universe 
jai guru de va om 

nothing's gonna change my world 
nothing's gonna change my world. 
nothing's gonna change my world 
nothing's gonna change my world. 

sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing 
through my open ears inciting and inviting me 
limitless undying love which shines around me like a 
million suns, it calls me on and on 
across the universe 
jai guru de va om 

nothing's gonna change my world 
nothing's gonna change my world. 
nothing's gonna change my world 
nothing's gonna change my world. 

jai guru de va, jai guru de va 
jai guru de va, jai guru de va 
jai guru de va, jai guru de va,
jai guru de va
