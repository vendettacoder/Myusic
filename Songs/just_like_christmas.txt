on our way from stockholm
started to snow
and you said it was like christmas
but you were wrong
it wasn't like christmas at all

by the time we got to oslo
snow was gone
and we got lost
the beds were small
but we felt so young
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas

it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
it was just like christmas
