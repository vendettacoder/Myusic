some things are worth the bruises
some things are worth the hurt
i like the way your face looks towards me
try just a little harder
try and make this time for me
i like the way your glances deceive me

i gave myself away
and yes, i meant to give you warning
but what did i say
you can call me in the morning
i'm living my life in reverse

make me a compilation
make me do what you will
'cause i like the way you use your fingers
grant me a conversation
grant me a shard of your life
'cause i like the way your fringe shapes your features

i gave myself away
and yes, i meant to give you warning
but what did i say
you can call me in the morning
i'm living my life in reverse

i'm living my life in reverse order
and yes, i tried to warn ya
i'm living my life in reverse order
and since you ask, well i tried to warn her

watching the light stretch through the curtains
watching the evening fade
i like the way that you fold your body
