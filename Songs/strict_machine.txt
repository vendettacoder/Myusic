i get high on a buzz
then a rush when i'm plugged in you
i connect
when i'm flush
you get love when told what to do

wonderful electric
wonderful electric
wonderful electric
cover me in you

i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love with a strict machine

i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love with a strict machine

when you send me a pulse
feel a wave of new love
through me
i'm dressed in white noise
you know just what i want
so please

wonderful electric
wonderful electric
wonderful electric
cover me in you

i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love with a strict machine

i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love with a strict machine ...
