in the event of something happening to me
there is something i would like you all to see
it's just a photograph of someone that i knew

have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what it's like on the outside?
don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide,
mr. jones.

i keep straining my ears to hear a sound
maybe someone is digging underground
or have they given up and all gone home to bed?
thinking those who once existed must be dead?

have you seen my wife, mr. jones?
do you know what it's like on the outside?
don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide,
mr. jones
