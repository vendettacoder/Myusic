well i'm a human fly
i-i said f-l-y
i say "buzz buzz buzz"
a-and it's just becuz
i-i'm a human fly
a-and i don't know why
i got 96 tears and 96 eyes

i got a garbage brain
that's drivin' me insane
and i don't like the ride
so push that pest aside
and baby i won't care
'cuz baby i don't scare
'cuz i'm a reborn maggot using germ warfare
rock!

i-i'm a human fly
i-i said f-l-y
i-i say "bzz bzz bzz"
a-and it's just becuz
i'm a unzipped fly
a-and i don't know why
and i don't know why
but i say,

bzzzzzzz
rock tonight, and i say
bzzzzzzz
rocket ride, and i say
bzzzzzzz
but i don't know why
aw, i just don't know why
