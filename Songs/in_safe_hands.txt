i'll leave you now
in safe hands
cool your soul
it's love still stands

but failing that
just cool down
wouldn't you love to make it
is this real or am i just
imagining?

with wings take flight
the rose of why
and with that rose
the case is closed

but i need you now
to help me somehow
well i'm scared to face it
this final kiss
but i know i'll remember it

you gave your best to me
allow yourself to be
free

it raids your memory
still i'm sorry for failing
a time for change
well i need you now
to help me out
well i'm scared to face this
a final kiss
but i know you'll remember it
