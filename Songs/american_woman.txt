american woman, stay away from me
american woman, mama, let me be
don't come a-hangin' around my door
i don't wanna see your face no more
i got more important things to do
than spend my time growin' old with you
now woman, i said stay away
american woman, listen what i say

american woman, get away from me
american woman, mama, let me be
don't come a-knockin' around my door
don't wanna see your shadow no more
coloured lights can hypnotize
sparkle someone else's eyes
now woman, i said get away
american woman, listen what i say, hey

american woman, said get away
american woman, listen what i say
don't come a-hangin' around my door
don't wanna see your face no more
i don't need your war machines
i don't need your ghetto scenes
coloured lights can hypnotize
sparkle someone else's eyes
now woman, get away from me
american woman, mama, let me be

i'm gonna leave you, woman

goodbye, american woman
