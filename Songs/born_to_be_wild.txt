get your motor running
head out on the highway
looking for adventure
and whatever comes our way

yeah, darling go make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once and
explode into space

i like smoke and lightning
heavy metal thunder
racing with the wind
and the feeling that i'm under

yeah darling go make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once
and explode into space

like a true nature's child
we were born, born to be wild
we can climb so high
i never want to die

born to be wild
born to be wild
