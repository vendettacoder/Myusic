hey garland i dig your tweed coat
            i'll trade you a domino this size
            mothballs scented
            the woman silk nude tie
            painting his chest
            one celluloid stay, exposed through his nibbled collar
            feet speckled the sidewalk
            faces gurgled through windows
            passing cars gum rubber streaks
            neon plants swim like green seaweed to a deep rhythm of blues
            red thyroid sunsets
            flame and speckled chemistry
            pipes run off dark tubes
            erase into marks that pour the dye of darkness
            crystal comes together as silent as ink
            "i don't think i could let it go, i got it at the religious scene"
            teeth let go
            tobacco juice
            an oiled balloon
            brown eye in an egg whit
            black tar bubbles in stripes
            a straw hat squeaked on the brim of a feather
            newsprint thumbed through nicotine fingers
            a dark olive was turned on
            its small pulp speaker, burst into a scream
            one large tomato was immediately peeled skin red
            it bled into a red 'o' and smacked behind accepted fangs
            quick eyebrows danced cutely above a mole
            the front was smooth
            it gradually gathered and wrinkled at the holes
            a dark wooden moustache deposited below above chinese red varnished lips
            that dented slightly into the evening
            "it's gotten quite cold - i've decided i can't sell you my coat"
            honking the wind puffed into the clumps above the lattice rows
            and out looked panatella
            naked and not ashamed
            without no clothes wiggle pig went snout first into a tree
            the rubber turkey was gobbled up by night's dark rubber mouth
            a white phosphorous raindrop dropped in the sky
            hot silhouettes in a convertible
            gave this a applause
            and several white porcelain trays were rolled in by bumble bees
            their wings arranged with pictures out of the past
            and the rainbow baboon gobbled fifteen fish eyes with each spoon
            pockets was caught at window level
            approaching the fractured glass dripping in light he spoke
            "i just looked at myself
            and from here to there it ain't far enough
            but from here to there
            it's too short"
            "and circles don't fly, they float"
            pena exclaimed
            and went on to say
            "sun shore did shine this year
            who'd you look like underneath?"
