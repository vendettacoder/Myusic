we have all the time in the world
time enough for life to unfold
all the precious things love has in store
we have all the love in the world
if that's all we have, you will find
we need nothing more

every step of the way will find us
with the cares of the world far behind us

we have all the time in the world
just for love
nothing more
nothing less
only love

every step of the way will find us
with the cares of the world far behind us
yes...

we have all the time in the world
just for love
nothing more
nothing less
only love
