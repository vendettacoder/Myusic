verse one: 
i met this girl, when i was ten years old 
and what i loved most she had so much soul 
she was old school, when i was just a shorty 
never knew throughout my life she would be there for me 
ont he regular, not a church girl she was secular 
not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her 
but i respected her, she hit me in the heart 
a few new york niggaz, had did her in the park 
but she was there for me, and i was there for her 
pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her 
and just cool out, cool out and listen to her 
sittin on a bone, wishin that i could do her 
eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be 
because we related, physically and mentally 
and she was fun then, i'd be geeked when she'd come around 
slim was fresh yo, when she was underground 
original, pure untampered and down sister 
boy i tell ya, i miss her 
verse two: 
now periodically i would see 
ol girl at the clubs, and at the house parties 
she didn't have a body but she started gettin thick quick 
did a couple of videos and became afrocentric 
out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions 
she was on that tip about, stoppin the violence 
about my people she was teachin me 
by not preachin to me but speakin to me 
in a method that was leisurely, so easily i approached 
she dug my rap, that's how we got close 
but then she broke to the west coast, and that was cool 
cause around the same time, i went away to school 
and i'm a man of expandin, so why should i stand in her way 
she probably get her money in l.a. 
and she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul 
she said that the pro-black, was goin out of style 
she said, afrocentricity, was of the past 
so she got into r&amp;b hip-house bass and jazz 
now black music is black music and it's all good 
i wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood 
cause that was good for her, she was becomin well rounded 
i thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit 
just havin fun, not worried about anyone 
and you could tell, by how her titties hung 
verse three: 
i might've failed to mention that the shit was creative 
but once the man got you well he altered the native 
told her if she got an energetic gimmick 
that she could make money, and she did it like a dummy 
now i see her in commercials, she's universal 
she used to only swing it with the inner-city circle 
now she be in the burbs lickin rock and dressin hip 
and on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city 
talkin about poppin glocks servin rocks and hittin switches 
now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches 
always smokin blunts and gettin drunk 
tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk 
stressin how hardcore and real she is 
she was really the realest, before she got into showbiz 
i did her, not just to say that i did it 
but i'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it 
that she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her 
i see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer 
but i'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop 
cause who i'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop
