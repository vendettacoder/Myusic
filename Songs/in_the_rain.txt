i wanna go outside in the rain
it may sound crazy
but i wanna go outside (go outside) in the rain

now i, i think i'm gonna cry
and i, i don't want you to see me cry

i wanna go outside in the rain
it may sound crazy
but i wanna go outside in the rain

once the rain starts fallin'
on my face (on my face)
you won't see (you won't see, ah)
a single trace (a single trace)

but the tears i'm cryin' (i'm cryin')
because of you i'm cryin' (because of you)
don't want you to see me cry
let me go, let me go, let me go

once the sun comes out
and the rain is gone away

i know i'm gonna see
a better day

but right now i think i'm cryin' (i'm cryin')
because of you i'm cryin' (because of you)
don't want you to see me cry (i'm cryin')
let me go, let me go, let me go

in the rain (in the rain)
it might sound crazy, but
it might sound crazy, but
but i wanna go outside in the rain
i wanna go outside (i wanna go outside)
i wanna go outside (in the rain)
it may sound crazy
i said, it may sound crazy, but
but i wanna go outside in the rain

i wanna go outside (i wanna go outside)
i wanna go outside (in the rain)
it may sound crazy
i said, it may sound crazy
but i wanna go outside in the rain
