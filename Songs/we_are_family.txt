as we walk on by
(and) and we fly just like birds of a feather

living life is fun and we've just begun
to get our share of this world's delights
(high) high hopes we have for the future
and our goal's in sight

(we) no, we don't get depressed
here's what we call our golden rule
have faith in you and the things you do
you won't go wrong, oh no
this is our family jewel

we are family (hey, sing it to me)
i got all my sisters with me
we are family (oh, i can hear you now)
get up everybody and sing

i got all my sisters with me
we are family (get up, get up y'all)
get up everybody and sing
