in fact it's the earth which he's known since birth
he lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
in fact it's the earth which he's known since birth
he lies on his side, is he trying to hide? (he lies on his side)
in fact it's the earth which he's known since birth (is he trying to hide?)
he lies on his side, is he trying to hide? (he lies on his side)
in fact it's the earth which he's known since birth (is he trying to hide?)
he lies on his side, is he trying to hide? (he lies on his side)
in fact it's the earth
