they say people out in hollywood
live their life out in black and white
they're living out a technicolor dream
next day they're a star overnight

not like in new york
man, it's tougher
not like in london town
boy, you suffer

nobody give a break
when you're down on your luck
everybody's on the take
when you're down on your luck
you can't make a mistake
when you're down on your luck

people out in hollywood
they got a lot of class
you see the boys strutting down the boulevard
trying to make a pass

not like in new york
it's high rise, it's concrete and complex
not like in london town
it reigns down on its subjects

nobody give a damn
when you're down on your luck
nobody understands
when you're down on your luck
lady chance, she won't dance
when you're down on your luck

people out in hollywood
they can make it to the stars
they can reach the screen
drive around in big expensive convertible cars

not like in new york
all you've got is broadway
not like in the west end of london
you can't make it no way

nobody give a damn
when you're down on your luck
nobody understands
when you're down on your luck
lady chance, she won't dance
when you're down on your luck

you've got to strut your stuff
when you're down on your luck
you can't take it easy, it ain't good enough
when you're down on your luck
everybody's on the make
when you're down on your luck

nobody give a fair deal
when you're down on your luck
nobody understands my uncle sam
when you're down on your luck
i'm ready for the dance
when you're down on your luck

i got to make a dollar holler
when you're down on your luck
mama, mama, mama, mama
when you're down on your luck
