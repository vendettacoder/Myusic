give me a window with one way glass
to look out on the world and watch people pass
give me a window to shield me
where i can't be seen, i don't wanna be free

give me a window to stop the sound
to keep out the noise of the merry-go-round
give me a window with one way glass
to stop me from questions i might have to ask
