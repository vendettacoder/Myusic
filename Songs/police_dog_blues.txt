all my life i've been a travelin' man
all my life i've been a travelin' man
stayin' alone and doin' the best i can

i shipped my trunk down to tennessee
i shipped my trunk down to tennessee
hard to tell about a man like me

i met a gal, i couldn't get her off my mind
i met a gal, i couldn't get her off my mind
she passed me up, said she didn't like my kind

i'm scared to bother around her house at night
i'm scared to bother around her house at night
she got a police dog cravin' for a fight

his name is rambler, when he gets a chance
his name is rambler, when he gets a chance
he leaves his mark on everybody's pants

guess i'll travel, i guess i'll let her be
guess i'll travel, i guess i'll let her be
before she sicks her police dog on me
