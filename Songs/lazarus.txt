i must be losing my mind
i keep on trying to find a way out
there's no need, you don't lock the door anymore

i, you know i never go out
and you know i start to forget things
it's ok they weren't essential anyway

and i, when i start to think back
i feel like i've spent my whole life just kicking round
and not getting in the way

and now, and maybe now i should change
because i'm starting to lose all my faith
while those around me are beaten down each day.
