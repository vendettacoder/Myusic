by the rivers of babylon
where he sat down
and there he wept
when he remembered zion

'cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
required from us a song
how can we sing king alpha's song
in a strange land?

'cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
required from us a song
how can we sing king alpha's song
in a strange land?

sing it out loud
sing a song of freedom, brother
sing a song of freedom, sister

so, let the words of our mouth
and the meditation of our heart
be acceptable in thy sight
oh, fari

so, let the words of our mouth
and the meditation of our heart
be acceptable in thy sight
oh, fari

we got to sing it together
everyone
la la la la la

by the rivers of babylon
where he sat down
and there he wept
when he remembered zion

'cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
required from us a song
how can we sing king alpha's song
in a strange land?
