come along my brother come along
let us do the things we are supposed to do for our mother
come along my sister come along too
and if we should live up in there, in there, in there, in there, in the hills

and if we should live up in the hills (repeat 3 times)

my brother go, go to the river
to carry the water.  the water
my sister wash up the dishes
she even goes to the shop
and bring in the grocery
when my smaller brother run around
and pick up the bramble to keep the fire blazing
to keep, to keep mama fire blazing, 
blazing fire, fire

and if we should live up in the hills (repeat once)

my mother hard at work
work my mother for ya children
my mother hard at work
work my mother for ya children
my daddy he's down
way over, far over
working out the cultivation
come in with food daddy
come in daddy come
come with food come

and if we should live up in the hills
