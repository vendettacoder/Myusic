i'm going away 
to find the sun 
i'm going today 

i'm going away 
to find the sun 
no more to say 

i'm going away 
to find the love 
i'm going away 

it's all about the way you move 
it's all about the way you move 
it's all about the way you laugh, 
the way you smile and walk the path 
all about the way you move 

i'm going away 
to find the sun 
no love today 

i'm going away 
goodbye to love 
there's no more to say
