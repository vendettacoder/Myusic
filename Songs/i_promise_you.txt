i promise you warm nights
i promise you long days
i promise you summer twilight
i promise you soft waves

but first we must bear
the winter

i promise you blue skies
i promise you the rolling moors
i promise you barefoot sunrise
i promise you open doors

but first we must bear 
the winter

the rain and the gates
and the frost and the hail
the hard biting nails
of winter

i promise you light returning
i promise you hope reborn
i promise you gentle mornings
i promise you new dawn

but first we must bear
the winter
