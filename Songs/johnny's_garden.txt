there's a place
i can get to
where i'm safe
from the city blues
and its green
and its quiet
only trouble was
i had to buy it

and i'll do anything i got to do
cut my hair and shine my shoes
and keep on singin' the blues
if i can stay here in johnny's garden

as the swift bird
flies over the grasses
dipping now and then
to take his breakfast
thus i come and go
and i travel
and i can watch that bird
and unravel

and i'll do anything i got to do
cut my hair and shine my shoes
and keep on singin' the blues
if i can stay here in johnny's garden

with his love
and his carin'
he puts his life
into beauty sharin'
and his children
are his flowers
there to give us peace
in quiet hours

and i'll do anything i got to do
cut my hair and shine my shoes
and keep on singin' the blues
if i can stay here in johnny's garden
