maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could
little things i should have said and done
i never took the time

you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
if i made you feel second best
i'm so sorry i was blind

you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me, one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
give me, one more chance to keep you satisfied

you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind

maybe i didn't treat you
quite as good as i should
maybe i didn't love you
quite as often as i could
maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
