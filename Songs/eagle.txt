they came flying from far away
now i'm under their spell
i love hearing the stories that they tell

they've seen places beyond my land
and they've found new horizons
they speak strangely but i understand

and i dream i'm an eagle
and i dream i can spread my wings

flying high, high
i'm a bird in the sky
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

high, high
what a feeling to fly
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that i please

as all good friends we talk all night
and we fly wing to wing
i have questions and they know everything

there's no limit to what i feel
we climb higher and higher
am i dreaming or is it all real?

is it true i'm an eagle?
is it true i can spread my wings?

flying high, high
i'm a bird in the sky (i'm an eagle)
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

high, high
what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that i please

and i dream i'm an eagle
and i dream i can spread my wings

flying high, high
i'm a bird in the sky (i'm an eagle)
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

high, high-igh
what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
over mountains and forests and seas

high, high
i'm a bird in the sky (i'm an eagle)
i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

high, high-igh
what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that i please
