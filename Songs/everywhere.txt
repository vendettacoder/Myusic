(calling out your name)
(calling out your name)

can you hear me calling
out your name?
you know that i'm falling
and i don't know what to say

i'll speak a little louder
i'll even shout
you know that i'm proud
and i can't get the words out

oh, i
i want to be with you everywhere
oh, i
i want to be with you everywhere
(wanna be with you everywhere)

something's happening
happening to me
my friends say i'm acting peculiarly

come on, baby
we better make a start
you better make it soon
before you break my heart

oh, i
i want to be with you everywhere
oh, i
i want to be with you everywhere
(wanna be with you everywhere)

can you hear me calling
out your name?

i want to be with you everywhere
oh, i
i want to be with you everywhere
