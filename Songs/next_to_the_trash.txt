she puts my body away
next to the trash
under the sink
along with all of the cleaning supplies
and the things that we buy and decide we don't need

well it's damp and it's dark and it's lonely in here
next to the trash
under the sink
but everyone needs some time off now and then
'cause i'm happy my friends
don't feel sorry for me

she says if you're playin' a game
i hope you know you won't win it
and if you tell me you're next to the trash
well i'll tell you i'm in it
why would you want me to touch you if you know i don't mean it?
she's right, i'm mean when i'm bored
so i dig through the trash looking for her
she can wash herself off
in the mist from the pipes
we could use more of that around here that's for sure

but it seems whoever has thrown her away
has forgotten the trash under the sink
or was it a joke meant to buy her some time?
all the citrus and pine make it harder to think

so i say if you're playing a game
i hope you know you won't win it
and i'll be sorry if they threw you away
it's just that they didn't
she says "boy, you'd better take it back right now and i mean it"

she puts my body away
then chases my mind up to the roof
it jumps in the gutter
but she pulls it out
and it's all part of having a man in the house
it jumps in the gutter
she pulls it out
and it's all part of having a man in the house
