two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'round the outside, 'round the outside
two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'round the outside, 'round the outside

(ooh)
guess who's back, back, back? 
back again, gain, gain
shady's back, back, back
tell a friend

guess who's back, guess who's back?
guess who's back, guess who's back?
guess who's back, guess who's back?
guess who's back, la, la, la

i've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more they want shady, i'm chopped liver
well if you want shady, this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
then a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

you waited this long to stop debating
'cause i'm back, i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job, ms. cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating

so the fcc won't let me be 
or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me

so, come on dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits, "fuck you debbie."

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me 

i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me 

little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed, their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners, helpless
till someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

a visionary, vision is scary
could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves 
a rebel, so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissin' my ass

and it's a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
well i'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then i'm gonna enter in it 

up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention, back for the winter
i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kids ears and nesting

"testing, attention please"
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
a nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? 

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me 

i said this looks like a job for me

a tisk-it a task-it, i'll go tit for tat wit'
anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
chris kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards

and moby, you can get stomped by obie
you 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
you don't know me, you're too old, let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno

now let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol

but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me i'm just obscene (hey)

though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'll be so empty without me

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me 

i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

na na na na na, na na na na na
na na na na na, na na na na
na na na na na, na na na na na
na na na na na, na na na na
