take me to the station 
and put me on a train 
i've got no expectations 
to pass through here again 

once i was a rich man 
and now i am so poor 
but never in my sweet short life 
have i felt like this before 

you heart is like a diamond 
you throw your pearls at swine 
and as i watch you leaving me 
you pack my peace of mind 

our love was like the water 
that splashes on a stone 
our love is like our music 
it's here and then it's gone 

so take me to the airport 
and put me on a plane 
i got no expectations 
to pass through here again
