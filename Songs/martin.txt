just want to tell 'bout martin
cause nobody i know's got a brother like him
as kids we could never be parted
the neighbours all knew us as the terible twins
at school some kids where always looks for a fight
and martin never wanted a fuss
ol' big mouth brown thought he's push us around 
being three year older than us
so i smash him in the teeth with a cloakroom stool 
got six of the best and suspended from school

but it was worth with a brother like martin
(martin)
it was worth it with a brother like him

we used to nick motors for a joy ride 
'till we rammed a black mariah in this xj 6 
to give my brother time to get clear 
i had to punch a few policemen before i was nicked
got borstal for taking and driving away
and beating up the boys in blue
but martin never missed a single visiting day
hitched from clapham to crewe
with all me racing mags and the little bits of news

smuggling in ciggies and a little bit of booze

no one ever had a brother like martin 
no one ever had a brother like him

look, people get the wrong impression with martin
i know he didn't mix much but he's no snob
the weekend i got out of remand home
he got uncle ruby to find me this job 
and back at my nan's he'd repainted my room
and bought me a brand new carpet
there was all me old records and books on a shelf
and a secondhand telly from the market
you can get a bit hard when you've been inside
but i hugged the old bastard and i almost cried 

cos no-one ever had a brother like martin
no-one ever had a brother like him

(cos no-one ever had a brother like martin 
no-one ever had a brother like him)
