(don't hold back)
'cause you woke up in the morning with initiative to move
so i'll make it harder

(don't hold back)
if you think about it so many people do
be cool, man, look smarter

(don't hold back)
and you shouldn't even care
about the losers in the air and their crooked stares

(don't hold back)
'cause there's a party over here
so you might as well be here where the people care
(don't hold back)

the world (they're holding back)
the time has come to
the world (they're holding back)
the time has come to

the world (they're holding back)
the time has come to
galvanize

(they're holding back) come on, come on

(don't)
(don't)
(don't)
(don't)

(don't hold back)
if you think about it too much
you may stumble, trip up, fall on your face

(don't hold back)
you think it is time you get up
crunch time like a sit up, the monkey pace

(don't hold back)
put apprehension of the back burner
let it sit, don't even get it lit

(don't hold back)
get involved with the jam
don't be a prick, hot chick, be a pig

the world (they're holding back)
the time has come to
the world (they're holding back)
the time has come to

the world (they're holding back)
the time has come to
louder now, come on, come on

world
the time has come to (push the button)
world
the time has come to (push the button)

world
the time has come to (push the button)
world
my finger is on the button

my finger is on the button
my finger is on the button
(push the button)

the time has come to
galvanize

(don't)
