spending my day thinkin' 'bout you girl
being here with you, being near with you
i can't explain myself
why i feel like i do
though it hurts me so to let you know that i
look in your eyes to let me know
how you feel
let me know that love is really real
and it seems to me
that i'm wrapped up in your love

[chorus:]
don't you know that i'm
(still in love, in love with you)
sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey

and i look in your eyes
and all the years i see
me lovin' you and you lovin' me
well it seems to me
that i'm wrapped up in your love

[chorus:]
don't you know that i'm
(still in love, in love with you)
sho' 'nuff in love with you
hey, ah-ha, ah, ah, ah, ah
hey, ah-ha
don't you know that i'm
(still in love, in love with you)
sho' 'nuff in love with you
say i try it if you want me to
ah-ha, ah-ha, aah, ah, ah, ah
