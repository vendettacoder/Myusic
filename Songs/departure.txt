i discern a subtle stream converging in the quiet
just behind the silence, my mind has slipped inside it
i can feel a past being fed me, a second hand future's misled me
second hand future's misled me, i feel a fate being fed me

to devour my memories in a single sitting
seems the only means, the only means befitting
a reunion with my beloved, a reunion with the sun
a reunion with the stars, a reunion with the sun

though i know endless dawn awaits, still i rotate at the gate
to watch my life escape never turning as it runs
my reunion with the sun never turning as it runs
never turning as it runs, my reunion with the sun, my reunion with the stars
i discern a subtle stream converging in the quiet 
just behind the silence my mind has slipped inside it
my mind has slipped inside it, (?)
(?), my mind has slipped inside it
