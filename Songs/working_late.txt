steaks are getting cold on the table 
i've got the tv on to "that's incredible" 
in the yellow oven is hot apple pie 
so why isn't he home on time? 

he's working late (he's working late) 
and there's nothing in the world you can do 
to bring him home to you 
when he says he's working late 

when we first moved in together he just couldn't wait 
to hold me in his arms, he'd never hesitate 
talking words of love, making me feel like a little girl 
and now he's living in another world 

he's working late (he's working late) 
and there's nothing in the world you can do 
to bring him home to you 
when he says he's working late 

do you give him all the love you can? 
well, sometimes i guess i don't 
do you think he's looking for something he can't find at home? 
well, the more i wonder, the less i know 

i just got woken up by the tv set 
there ain't no more shows on and he ain't home yet 
i try to close my eyes and fool myself 
that he would never fall in love with someone else 

he's working late (he's working late) 
and there's nothing in the world you can do 
to bring him home to you 
when he says he's working late 

(he's working late) 
and there's nothing in the world you can do 
to bring him home to you 
when he says he's working late 

(he's working late) 
oh, i know he's working 
(he's working late) 
well, he just better be working late
