a thought that never changes
remains a stupid lie
it's never been quite the same
no hearing or breathing
no movement, no colour

just silence
rise and fall of shame
a search that shall remain
we asked you what you'd seen
you said you didn't care

sound formed in a vacuum
may seem a waste of time
it's always been just the same
no hearing or breathing
no movement, no lyrics
just nothing
a sign that leads the way
the path we cannot take
you've caught me at a bad time
so, why don't you piss off?
