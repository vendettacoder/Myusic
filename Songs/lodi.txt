just about a year ago
i set out on the road
seekin' my fame and fortune
lookin' for a pot of gold
things got bad, and things got worse
i guess you will know the tune
oh, lord, stuck in lodi again

rode in on the greyhound
i'll be walkin' out if i go
i was just passin' through
must be seven months or more
ran out of time and money
looks like they took my friends
oh, lord, i'm stuck in lodi again

the man from the magazine
said i was on my way
somewhere i lost connections
ran out of songs to play
i came into town, a one-night stand
looks like my plans fell through
oh, lord, stuck in lodi again

if i only had a dollar
for ev'ry song i've sung
ev'ry time i've had to play
while people sat there drunk
you know, i'd catch the next train
back to where i live
oh, lord, stuck in lodi again
oh, lord, i'm stuck in lodi again
