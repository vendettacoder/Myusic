colonise the moon, colonise the moon
with all the bad ideas
and all the hopes but none of their fears
and all the market leaders
and all the hopes, and all the hopes
and all the hopes but none of their fears

i vomited throughout, i vomited throughout
throughout your saxophone solo
and all those notes you bellow
and all the notes, and all the notes
and all the notes you bellow

and you said: hmmm

colonise the moon, colonise the moon
with all the bad equations
colonise the moon, colonise the moon
with all the warring factions
they'll fight it out, they'll fight it out
they'll fight until extinction

colonise the moon, colonise the moon
with all the bad ideas
