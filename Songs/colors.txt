i am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
king of my jungle just a gangster stalking
living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
then dead as a deathpack the colors i choose
red or blue, cuz or blood, it just don't matter
suckers dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
the gangs of l.a. will never die - just multiply

you see they hit us then we hit them
then we hit them and they hit us, man
it's like a war, ya know what i'm sayin'
people dont even understand
they don't even know what they dealing with
you wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
but people don't understand the size of this
this is no joke man, this is real

you don't know me, fool
you disown me, cool
i don't need your assistance, social persistance
any problem i got i just put my fist in
my life is violent but violent is life
peace is a dream, reality is a knife
my colors, my honor, my colors, my all
with my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
tell me what have you left me, what have i got
last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
my home boy got jacked
my mother's on crack
my sister can't work cause her arms show trax
madness insanity live in profanity
then some punk claimin' they understandin' me
give me a break, what world do you live in
death is my set, guess my religion

yo my brother was a gang banger
and all my homeboys bang
i don't know why i do it man, i just do it
i never had much of nuffin man
look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
and i ain't got nuffin man, i've got nuffin
i'm living in the ghetto man
just look at me man, look at me

my pants are saggin' braided hair
suckers stare but i don't care
my game ain't knowledge my game's fear
i've no remorse so squares beware

but my true mission is just revenge
you ain't in my set, you ain't my friend
wear the wrong color your life could end
homicide's my favorite binge

listen to me man
no matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
you don't wanna be in it man,
you're just gonna end up in a mix of dead freinds and time in jail i
know, if
i had a chance like you,
i would never be in a gang man
but i didn't have a chance
you know i wish i did

i'll just walk like a giant police defiant
you'll say to stop but i'll say that i can't
my gangs my family its all that i have
i'm a star, on the wall's my autograph

you don't like it, so? you know where you can go
'cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
psycho-analize? try! diognising me?  why?
it wasn't your brother that brutally died

but it was mine, so let me define
my territory don't cross the line
don't try to act crazy
'cause that shit don't phase me
if you ran like a punk
it wouldn't amaze me
'cause my color's death
though we all want peace
but our war won't end,
'til all wars cease.

see the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
but i don't wanna be down with this situation man
but i'm in here, if i had something betta to do i think i'd do it but
right
now i'm just down here boye
i'm trying to get money cause i'm smart
i'm gunna get paid while i'm out here
i'm gunna get that paper, ya know what i'm saying
if i had a chance like you,
maybe i would be in school
but i'm not, i'm out here living day to day surviving
and i'm willing to die for my colors

yo'll please stop, cause i want ya all to live.
this is ice-t, peace...
