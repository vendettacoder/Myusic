(don raye - hughie prince)

he was a famous trumpet man from out chicago way
he had a boogie style that no one else could play
he was the top man at his craft
but then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
he's in the army now, a-blowin' reveille
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b

they made him blow a bugle for his uncle sam
it really brought him down because he couldn't jam
the captain seemed to understand
because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band
and now the company jumps when he plays reveille
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b

a-toot, a-toot, a-toot-diddelyada-toot
he blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm
he can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with 'im
he makes the company jump when he plays reveille
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b

he was our boogie woogie bugle boy of company b
and when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a 'bzzz' bee
and when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b

toot-toot-toot, toot-diddelyada, toot-diddelyada
toot, toot, he blows it eight-to-the-bar
he can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with 'im
a-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b

(instrumental interlude)

he puts the boys asleep with boogie every night
and wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
they clap their hands and stamp their feet
because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
he really breaks it up when he plays reveille
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b

da-dah-da-dah-da
da-dah-da-da-dah-da
da-dah-da-da-da

a-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
he's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b!
