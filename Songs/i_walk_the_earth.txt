when i walk through the earth,
i get stuck in the middle,
i can't see your love,
i don't know your love.

when i walk through the earth,
i get stuck in the middle,
i can't see your love
i don't know your love.

why won't you take me away?
take me a day,
keep on rising higher.

why won't you take me away?
take me a day,
keep on rising higher.

chorus x 8
hey, knock me,
picking on your own reality.

when i walk through the earth,
i get stuck in the middle,
i can't see your love,
i don't know your love.

when i walk through the earth,
i get stuck in the middle,
i can't see your love,
i don't know your love.

why won't you take me away?
take me a day,
keep on rising higher.

why won't you take me away?
take me a day,
keep on rising higher.

chorus x 8
hey, knock me,
picking on your own reality.

instrumental break

chorus to fade
hey, knock me,
picking on your own reality.
