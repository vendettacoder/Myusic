beautiful day i'd like to lie on the green lawn, 
the ducks are congregating round, round the lily pond, 
and the cows have all gone rinning home to put there coats on, 
stay indoors, while it pours, till to-morrow. 

i see the rain again, i must complain again, why does the rain let me down 
will you try to make it sunny in the morning? 

five to ten, now it's time for the weather, 
the sun will shine and in it's time, get better, 
but it won't last for long, clouds are spreading over london town, 
stay indoors, while it pours, till to-morrow. 

i see the rain again, i'll  take the blame again, i see the rain lets you down, 
but i'm gonna' make it sunny in the morning?
