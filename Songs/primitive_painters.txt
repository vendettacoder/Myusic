i just wish my life could be as strange as a conspiracy
i hold out home but there's no way of being what i want to be
the dragons blow fire angels fly spirits wither in the air
i'm just me i can't deny i'm neither here, there nor anywhere
oh you should see my trail of disgrace
(oh oh you should see my trail of disgrace)
it's enough to scare the whole human race
i said, oh you should see my trail of disgrace
(oh oh you should see my trail of disgrace)
it's enough to scare the whole human race, yeah, eminence

i don't care about this life, they say there'll be another one
defeatist attitude i know will you be sorry when i've gone
primitive painters are ships floating on an empty sea
gathering in galleries, we're stallions of imagery
oh you should see my trail of disgrace,
(oh oh you should see my trail of disgrace)
it's enough to hold the whole human race
i said oh you should see my trail of disgrace
(oh oh you should see my trail of disgrace)

(you should see my trail of disgrace)
and there's a look on your face, it's a human race
and if you just can't stand it, ah, i swear
