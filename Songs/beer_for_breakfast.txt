all i wanna do is drink beer for breakfast
all i wanna eat is them barbeque chips
all i want is someone to just try and protect us
you can try but never wanna try and defect us

i telling you i am through
mama's baby boy is a bum

all i wanna do is stay in this life
all i wanna pick is your nose, honey, hi
sweet little corny you've gotta be husky 
i am dreaming of a white christmas

honey where i'm from
mama's baby boy is a bum
honey where i'm from
halle-fucking-lujah
i'm a bum

baby boy's a bum
baby boy's a bum
baby boy's a bum
all i wanna do is drink beer for breakfast
