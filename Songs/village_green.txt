out in the country
far from all the soot
and noise of the city
there's a village green

it's been a long time
since i last set eyes
on the church with the steeple
down by the village green

'twas there i met a girl called daisy
and kissed her by the old oak tree
although i loved my daisy, i saw fame
and so i left the village green

i miss the village green
and all the simple people
i miss the village green
the church, the clock, the steeple
i miss the morning dew
fresh air and sunday school

and now all the house
are rare antiquities
american tourists
flock to see the village green

they snap their photographs and say "god darn it
isn't it a pretty scene?"
and daisy's married tom the grocer boy
and now he owns a grocery

i miss the village green
and all the simple people
i miss the village green
the church, the clock, the steeple
i miss the morning dew
fresh air and sunday school

and i will return there
and i'll see daisy
and we'll sip tea, laugh
and talk about the village green
we will laugh and talk about the village green
