lulu boom bang a bang

come closer, come closer and listen
the beat of my heart keeps on missing
i notice it most when we're kissing
come closer and love me tonight
that's right
come closer and cuddle me tight

my heart goes 
boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
when you are near
boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
loud in my ear
pounding away, pounding away
won't you be mine?
boom bang-a-bang-bang all the time

it's such a lovely feeling
when i'm in your arms
don't go away
i wanna stay my whole life through
boom bang-a-bang-bang
close to you

your smile is so warm and inviting
the thought of your kiss is exciting
so hold me and don't keep me waiting
come closer and love me tonight
that's right
come closer and cuddle me tight

my heart goes
boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
when you are near
boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
loud in my ear
pounding away, pounding away
won't you be mine?
boom bang-a-bang-bang all the time

it's such a lovely feeling
when i'm in your arms
now you are near
i wanna hear your heartbeat too
boom bang-a-bang-bang
i love you

it's such a lovely feeling
when i'm in your arms
now you are near
i wanna hear your heartbeat too
boom bang-a-bang-bang
boom bang-a-bang-bang
boom bang-a-bang-bang
