on a train, heading east of here
where i'll end up, i'm not quite clear
but i can't help myself, i must be settling down
until they stop this thing, i'll get around

when i hear it's been done before
and i hear it's a simple thing
then i hear it's quite difficult
and i hear almost everything

pass through deserts with mountain streams
outside my window, the scene's serene
the day i find myself i'll be so very proud
and i will not get passed up in the crowd

when i hear it's been done before
and i hear it's a simple thing
then i hear it's quite difficult
and i hear

now i'm not trying to cut anyone down
but i know it's been going on too long
simply doing what you feel
is the best way not to go wrong
but i know it seems crazy
and it might be a struggle
but i can't believe all this is true
so i'm here, i'm uneasy, and i'm ready to go
and i won't stop until this thing goes round and round
and i can sing like i will never know

when i hear it's been done before
and i hear it's a simple thing
then i hear it's quite difficult
and i hear

when i hear it's been done before
and i hear it's a simple thing
then i hear it's quite difficult
and i hear almost everything
