hey, matt
yeah, tim?
hey, you talked to mark lately?
uh, haven't really talked to him, but he looks pretty, uh, down
"he looks pretty, uh, down". yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
what do you, uh, suppose we should do?
well, does he like butter tarts?

i was lying on the grass of sunday morning of last week
indulging in my self-defeat
my mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
a comfortable three feet deep
now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
impaired my tribal lunar-speak
and of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done
so i missed a million miles of fun

i know it's up for me
(if you steal my sunshine)
making sure i'm not in too deep
(if you steal my sunshine)
keeping versed and on my feet
(if you steal my sunshine)

chad, come here, come here, come here!
wow, look at her!
i know!
wow, i've never seen sharon look so bad before.
i did once before, but this is pretty bad.
yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
well, i--sharon... i love you!

i was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
l-a-t-e-r that week
my sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
an incredible eight foot heap
now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat
involved an under usual feat
and i'm not only among but i invite you all to come
so i missed a million miles of fun

i know it's up for me
(if you steal my sunshine)
making sure i'm not in too deep
(if you steal my sunshine)
keeping versed and on my feet
(if you steal my sunshine)

i know it's done for me
(if you steal my sunshine)
not as some and hard to see
(if you steal my sunshine)
keeping dumb and built to beat
(if you steal my sunshine)

my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
my sunshine (if you steal my sunshine)
