i got your phone number, baby
i'll call you sometime
i think i might, be out tonight
maybe give you a ride
cocktails for two, down lover's lane
i wantcha so bad, after tonight
i'll never walk the same
and you're to blame

i wanna getcha high
i wanna get next to you
i wanna feel everything aboutcha, girl
i wanna feel good
you make me feel good

baby, you don't know
just how i lie awake
and dream awhile, about your smile
and the way you make yo ass shake
if that ain't love
i guess i'll never know
a sweeter lie, you'd be surprised
just how far i'd go
to make it so
