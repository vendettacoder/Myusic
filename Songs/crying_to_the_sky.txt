crying to the sky
searching for a silver lining
hoping that the clouds i'm climbing aren't hiding rain.

nowhere left to go,
for every show now disappoints me.
still the ghost of love lost haunts me till my dying day.

i could fly away,
over the river of tears.
but i think i'll stay,
to face all my troubles and fight like a man.
i won't fear.
love is near.

crying to the sky
weeping like a silver fountain,
praying on the holy mountain that it won't rain.

i could say goodbye
follow the sun and the moon
but that would be a lie.
my heart's in your hand
and i'm leading a band full of blues
just for you

crying to the sky
searching for a silver lining
hoping that the clouds i'm climbing aren't hiding rain.
