down in the willow garden
where me and my love did meet
as we sat a-courtin'
my love fell off to sleep
i had a bottle of burgundy wine
my love she did not know
so i poisoned that dear little girl
on the banks below

i drew a sabre through her
it was a bloody knife
i threw her in the river
which was a dreadful sign
my father often told me
that money would set me free
if i would murder that dear little girl
whose name was rose connolly

my father sits at his cabin door
wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
for his only son soon shall walk
to yonder scaffold high
my race is run, beneath the sun
the scaffold now waits for me
for i did murder that dear little girl
whose name was rose connelly
