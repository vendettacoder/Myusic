there's wheat in the field
and water in the stream
and salt in the mine
and an aching in me

i can longer stand and wonder
cos i'm driven by this hunger

so i'll jug some water, bake some flour,
store some salt and wait the hour

when thinking of love,
love is thinking for me
and the baker will come
and the baker i'll be

i'm depending on my labour,
the texture and the flavour

hey!

i can no longer stand and wonder
cos i'm driven by this hunger

so i'll jug some water, bake some flour,
store some salt and wait the hour
