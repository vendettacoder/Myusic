going out each day to score
she was no whore but for me
celebrating every day
the way she thought it should be

and i don't know what to do
now that pink has turned to blue
and i don't know what to do
now that pink has turned to blue

she was always by my side
and never tried to leave
standing up for me
and like a tree for what she believed

and i don't know what to do
now that pink has turned to blue
and i don't know what to do
now that pink has turned to blue

no more rope and too much dope
she's lying on the bed
angels pacing
gently placing roses 'round her head
