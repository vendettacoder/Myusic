dark star crashes
pouring its light into ashes

reason tatters
the forces tear loose from the axis

searchlight casting
for faults in the clouds of delusion

shall we go, you and i, while we can?
through the transitive nightfall of diamonds

mirror shatters
in formless reflections of matter

glass hand dissolving
to ice petal flowers revolving

lady in velvet
recedes in the nights of goodbye

shall we go, you and i, while we can
through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?
