ten, twenty, thirty, forty, tell me that you wanna hold me
tell me that you wanna whore me, tell me that you gotta show me
tell me that you need to slowly
tell me that you're burning for me
tell me that you can't afford me
time to tell your dirty story
time turning over and over
time turning, four leaf clover

bettin' on the bull in the heather

ten, twenty, thirty, forty, tell me that you wanna scold me
tell me that you adore me, tell me that you're famous for me
tell me that you're gonna score me, tell me that you gotta show me
tell me that you need to sorely, time to tell your love story
time turning over and over, time turning, four leaf clover

bettin' on the bull in the heather
