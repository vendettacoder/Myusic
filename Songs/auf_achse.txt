you see her, you can't touch her 
you hear her, you can't hold her 
you want her, you can't have her 
you want to, but she won't let you 

you see her, you can't touch her 
you hear her, you can't hold her 
you want her, you can't have her 
you want to, but she won't let you 

she's not so special so look what you've done, boy 
she's not so special so look what you've done, boy 
she's not so special so look what you've done, boy 
she's not so special so look what you've done 

now you wish she'd never, come back here again 
oh..ho, never, come back here again 

you see her, you can't touch her 
you hear her, you can't hold her 
you want her, you can't have her 
you want to, but she won't let you 

you see her, you can't touch her 
you hear her, you can't hold her 
you want her, you can't have her 
you want to, but she won't let you 

she's not so special so look what you've done, boy 
she's not so special so look what you've done, boy 
she's not so special so look what you've done, boy 
she's not so special so look what you've done 

and now i'm nailed above you 
gushing from my side 
of your sins that you have killed me 
thinking of your sins i die 
thinking how you'd let them touch you 
how you'd never realise 
that i'm ripped and hang forsaken 
knowing never will i rise 
again 

you still see her 
oh, you hear her 
you want her 
oh, you want to 
you see her 
you still hear her 
you want her 
you still want to
