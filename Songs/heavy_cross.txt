oooh oooh ooh hooo
oooh oooh ooh oooh
oooh oooh ooh hooo
hooo oooh ooh hooo

it's a cruel cruel world to face on your own
a heavy cross to carry along
the lights are on, but everyone's gone
and it's cruel

it's a funny way to make ends meet
when the lights are out, on every street
it feels alright, but never complete
without joy

i checked you, if it's already been done
undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you
to prove it

on the rainy nights, even the coldest days
you're moments ago, but seconds away
the principal of nature, it's true but
it's a cruel world

oooh ooh oooh ooh hooo
oooh ooh oooh ooh hooo
oooh ooh oooh ooh hooo
oh hoo woah

we can play it safe or play it cool
follow the leader or make up all the rules
whatever you want, the choice is yours
so choose

i checked you, if it's already been done
undo it
it takes two and it's up to me and you
to prove it

ah ah ah eh aye aye
oh eh oh oh
yeah oh oh

ah ah ah eh ah aye
oh oh oh
yeah oh
yeah oh
yeah oh

i trust you, it's already been done
undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you
to prove it

ah ah aye
oh hoo woah
yeah eh

ah ah ah ah aye
oh-hoo woah
yeah oh

i checked you, if it's already been done
undo it
it takes two and it's up to me and you
to prove it
