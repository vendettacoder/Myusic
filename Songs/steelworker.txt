the only good policeman is a dead one
the only good laws aren't enforced
i've never hung a darkie, even a big one
i've never seen an indian on a horse
and i live like this 'cause i like it
and seen too much to pretend
you can't ignore the beauty in the things that you love
like you can't stand the hatred and the lies
have you always hunted with your hands?
can you show me what you've done?
have you always hunted with your hands?
if you catch it, can you kill it?
you don't understand, see you don't understand
see, i'm like a murderer, see, i'm like a murderer
and i could rip you limb from limb
and i could rip you limb from limb
great big thing crawlin' all over me
great big thing crawlin' all over me
see, i'm like a murderer, i kill what i eat
see, i'm like a, i'm a hunter-gatherer, see, i kill what i eat
see, i'm a steelworker, i kill what i eat
see, i'm, i'm a bricklayer, i kill what i eat
see, i'm a, i'm a murderer, i kill what i eat
see, i'm a, i'm a hunter-gatherer, i kill what i eat
see, i'm a steelworker, i kill what i eat
i'm a, i'm a bricklayer, i kill what i eat
great big thing crawling all over me
great big thing crawling all over me
great big thing crawling all over me
have you always hunted with your hands?
can you show me what you've done?
have you always hunted with your hands?
if you catch it, can you kill it?
i live like this 'cause i like it
and i've seen too much to pretend
you can't ignore the beauty in the things that you love
like you can't stand the hatred and the lies
see, see, see i'm a murderer, i kill what i eat
see, i'm, i'm a bricklayer, i kill what i eat
see, i'm a steelworker, i kill what i eat
it's a great big thing crawlin' all over me
great big thing crawlin' all over me
great big thing crawlin' all over me
