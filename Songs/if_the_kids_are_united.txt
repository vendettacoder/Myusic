for once in my life i've got something to say, 
i wanna say it now for now is today. 
a love has been given so why not enjoy, 
so let's all grab and let's all enjoy! 

if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided. 
if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided.  

just take a look around you, 
what do you see?
kids with feelings, 
like you and me. 
understand him, he'll understand you; 
for you are him, and he is you. 

if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided. 
if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided. 

if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided. 
if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided. 

i don't want to be rejected, 
i don't want to be denied. 
then its not my misfortune,
that i've opened up your eyes.

freedom is given, 
speak how you feel. 
i have no freedom, 
how do you feel?

they can lie to my face, 
but not to my heart.
if we all stand together, 
it will just be the start...

if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided. 
if the kids are united, 
then we'll never be divided.
