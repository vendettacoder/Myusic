last night i dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope, no harm
just another false alarm

last night i felt
real arms around me
no hope, no harm
just another false alarm

so tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?

this story is old
i know, but it goes on
this story is old
i know, but it goes on

it goes on
