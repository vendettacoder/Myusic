last week after "dynasty"
i had crows feet under my eyes
paid two days for getting high

freezing
wheezing
got pasted in a bar
i hope i've got the number

these are finest times of my life
this are the greatest times of my life
these are the biggest times of my life
(this are the greatest times of my life)

and just lately seeing you
i rise a.m. off pink sheets
i am renewed
i am aglow
red brick and green is the streets
you dressed today as if for riding school
your legs are so cool
came twice
you thrice

these is finest time of my life
these are the biggest times of my life
these are the greatest times of my life
(these are finest times of my life)
