hot town, summer in the city
back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
been down, isn't it a pity?
doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
all around, people looking half dead
walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

but at night it's a different world
go out and find a girl
come on, come on and dance all night
despite the heat it'll be all right

and babe, don't you know it's a pity
that the days can't be like the nights
in the summer, in the city
in the summer, in the city

cool town, evening in the city
dressing so fine and looking so pretty
cool cat, looking for a kitty
gonna look in every corner of the city
till i'm wheezing like a bus stop
running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop

but at night it's a different world
go out and find a girl
come on, come on and dance all night
despite the heat it'll be all right

and babe, don't you know it's a pity
that the days can't be like the nights
in the summer, in the city
in the summer, in the city

hot town, summer in the city
back of my neck getting dirty and gritty

but at night it's a different world
