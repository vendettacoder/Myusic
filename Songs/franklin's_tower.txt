in another time's forgotten space
your eyes looked from your mother's face
wallflower seed on the sand and stone
may the four winds blow you safely home

roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew

i'll tell you where the four winds dwell
in franklin's tower there hangs a bell
it can ring, turn night to day
it can ring like fire when you loose your way

roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew

god save the child that rings that bell
it may have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
one watch by night, one watch by day
if you get confused listen to the music play

some come to laugh their past away
some come to make it just one more day
whichever way your pleasure tends
if you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind

roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew

in franklin's tower the four winds sleep
like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
wildflower seed on the sand and wind
may the four winds blow you home again

roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew
you'd better roll away the dew

roll away the dew
roll away the dew
roll away the dew
you'd better roll away the dew - roll away
