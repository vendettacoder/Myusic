i'm caught in the flow of things
my memory's a broken machine
this is how my day begins
this is just one day unseen

let's do it serpentine any time
let's do it right here
let's do it serpentine, i don't mind
let's do it right here

is it bad that you're good for me?
did i love you just randomly?
i'm caught in the flow of sound
and you're just some melody

let's do it serpentine any time
let's do it right here
let's do it serpentine, i don't mind
let's do it right here

there's a cute little litany
put it on my shoulder
eight o'clock and we agree
it makes me look much older

got my clockwork's company
i got my dark green trenchcoat on
i'm sure it will always be
someone staying and someone gone

let's do it serpentine any time
let's do it right here
let's do it serpentine, i don't mind
let's do it right here
