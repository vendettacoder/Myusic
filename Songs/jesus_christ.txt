angels from the realms of glory
stars shone bright above
royal david's city
was bathed in light of love

jesus christ was born today
jesus christ was born
jesus christ was born today
jesus christ was born

lo, they did rejoice
fine and pure of voice
and the wrong shall fail
and the right prevail

jesus christ was born today
jesus christ was born
jesus christ was born today
jesus christ was born
and we're gonna get born now
