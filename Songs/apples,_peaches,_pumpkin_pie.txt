ready or not here i come
gee that used to be such fun

apples peaches pumpkin pie
who's not ready? holler "i"
that's a game we used to play.
hide and seek was its name.
oh ready or not, hear i come,
gee that used to be such fun.

i always used to find a hiding place,
times have changed.
well i'm one step behind you, but still i can't find you.
apple peaches pumpkin pie,
you were young and so was i.
now that we've grown up it seems
you just keep ignoring me.

[chorus]
i'll find you anywhere you go,
i'll follow you high and low.
you can't escape this love of mine anytime.
well, i'll sneak up behind you,
be careful where i find you.

apple peaches pumpkin pie,
soon your love will be all mine.
then i'm gonna take you home,
marry you so you won't roam.
marry you so you won't roam. right now

[chorus]

ready or not here i come,
gee that used to be such fun

[chorus: x3]
