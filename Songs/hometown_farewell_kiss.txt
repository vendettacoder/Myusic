my eyes are filled with light
my feet can't touch the ground
from up here i can see the sight
of my hometown city burning down

now it blazes for me house by house
and my legs they buckle under me
but i don't mind, t sing the old song of joy
for i know why and why it had to be

higher, let the flames grow higher
erase my name from your lips as we kiss
higher, let the flames grow higher
now there's one soul less on your fiery list
now there's one soul less on your fiery list

now i drive familiar smoky streets
i know this town, i know where to turn
all the while i kept a road map in my head
i just came back to see the people and their houses burn

one soul less on your fiery list
hometown farewell
this is my homekown farewell kiss
