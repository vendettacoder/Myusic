that's great, it starts with an earthquake
birds and snakes, an aeroplane
and lenny bruce is not afraid

eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
world serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs
feed it off an aux speed, grunt, no, strength
the ladder starts to clatter with a fear fight, down, height
wire in a fire, representing seven games
in a government for hire and a combat site
left to west and coming in a hurry with the furies
breathing down your neck

team by team reporters, baffled trump, tethered crop
look at that low plane, fine, then
uh-oh, overflow, population, common food
but it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
world serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
dummy with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
you vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
feeling pretty psyched

it's the end of the world as we know it
it's the end of the world as we know it
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine

six o'clock, tv hour, don't get caught in foreign towers
slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
locking in, uniforming, book burning, bloodletting
every motive escalate, automotive 'cinerate
light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
watch your heel crush, crush, uh-oh
this means no fear, cavalier, renegade, steer clear
a tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and i decline

it's the end of the world as we know it
(i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it
(i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine 
(it's time i had some time alone)
i feel fine
(i feel fine)

it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine
(it's time i had some time alone)

the other night i dreamt of knives, continental drift divide
mountains sit in a line, leonard bernstein
leonid brezhnev, lenny bruce, and lester bangs
birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom
you symbiotic, patriotic, slam book neck, right? right

it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine
(it's time i had some time alone)

it's the end of the world as we know it
it's the end of the world as we know it
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine
(it's time i had some time alone)

it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine
(it's time i had some time alone)

it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it
(it's time i had some time alone)
it's the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine
