my brother jake,
hat, shades,
head in a daze.
my brother jake,
have you though about
changin' your ways?

he goes out
he don't have no doubt
he don't have to know
what the world's about.

my brother jake,
head, down,
it's a scrapin' the ground,
jake, stay away,
you know you can always be down

he goes out
he don't have no doubt
he don't have to know
what the world's about.

i said jake,
now won't you wait,
what's got into you,
your candle is burning
the wheels are turning
what you gonna do?

my brother jake,
wont you start again
try makin' some friends
jake, it's not too late
to start again, by making amends

he goes out
he don't have no doubt
he don't have to know
what the world's about.

i said jake,
now won't you wait,
what's gone wrong with you,
your candle is burning
the wheels are turning
what you gonna do?

i said jake,
don't you wait,
what's gone wrong with you,
your candle is burning
the wheels of time are turning
uh! what you gonna do?

i said jake, jake, jake,
don't you wait, wait. wait,
what's got into you,
your candle is burning
the wheels of time are turning
uh! what you gonna do?

listen, i'm gonna break you jake,
because you got what it takes
to give a whole lotta people
some... soul.
