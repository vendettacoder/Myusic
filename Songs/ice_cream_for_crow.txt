it's so hot
    looks like you have three beaks, crow
    the moon's so full
    white hat on a pumpkin
    you know there's something
    the moon was a stone's throw
    stop the show
    i need to say hello to the crow
    light the fire piano
    the moon showed up
    and it started to show
    tonight there would be ice cream
    ice cream for crow
    ice cream by night
    sun cream by day
    ice cream for crow
    ice cream by night
    sun cream by day
    the sun ain't stable
    ice cream for crow
    crow pants the scarecrow
    crow dance ah ho ho
    crow dance
    a panther
    scarecrow you answer
    you can hee and haw
    laugh and scratch
    ha ha ha 
    ha ha ha
    boss and toss
    don't shake my hand
    give me your claw
    two tears in a haystack
    scarecrow get back
    tonight there will be
    a feather treatment
    beneath the symbol
    we'll all assemble
    oh how we'll fly
    oh how we'll tremble
    cut the cake
    we'll all get well
    turn up the speakers
    hop flop squawk
    it's a keeper
    ice cream for show
    oh ice cream for crow
    now now that's it
    now you can go
