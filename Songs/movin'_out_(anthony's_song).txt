anthony works in the grocery store
saving his pennies for some day
mama leone left a note on the door
she said, "sonny, move out to the country."
oh, but working too hard can give you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
you ought to know by now (you ought to know by now)

who needs a house out in hackensack?
is that all you get for your money?
and it seems such a waste of time
if that's what it's all about
mama, if that's moving up, then i'm movin' out
i'm movin' out, mmm, ooh, uh huh

sergeant o'leary is walking the beat
at night he becomes a bartender
he works at mr. cacciatorre's down on sullivan street
across from the medical center
yeah and he's trading in his chevy for a cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
you ought to know by now (you ought to know by now)

and if he can't drive with a broken back
at least he can polish the fenders
and it seems such a waste of time
if that's what it's all about
mama, if that's moving up, then i'm movin' out
i'm movin' out, oh, ooh, uh huh

you should never argue with a crazy man-man-man-man-man
you ought to know by now (you ought to know by now)

you can pay uncle sam with the overtime
is that all you get for your money?
and if that's what you have in mind
yeah, if that's what you're all about
good luck moving up, 'cause i'm movin' out
i'm movin' out, mmm, ooh, uh huh

i'm movin' out
