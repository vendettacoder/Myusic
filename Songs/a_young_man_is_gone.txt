oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
ah ah ah ah ahhhhh

now a young man's gone
but his legend lingers on
for so much had he to give

but his life is through
for the story told is true
for he died just as he lived

for this daring young star
met his death while in his car
no one knows the reason why

screaming tire, flashing fire
and gone was this young star
oh how could they let him die

still a young man is gone
yet his legend lingers on
for he died without a cause

and they say that he'll
be known for evermore
as the rebel without a cause
