do you feel like a chain store?
practically floored
one of many zeros
kicked around bored
your ears are full but you're empty
holding out your heart
to people who never really
care how you are

so give me coffee and tv
history
i've seen so much
i'm going blind
and i'm brain dead virtually
sociability
it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big bad world
and agree to marry me
so we can start over again

do you go to the country?
it isn't very far
there's people there who will hurt you
'cause of who you are
your ears are full of the language
there's wisdom there you're sure
'till the words start slurring
and you can't find the door

so give me coffee and tv
history
i've seen so much
i'm going blind
and i'm brain dead virtually
sociability
it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big bad world
and agree to marry me
so we can start over again

oh we could start all over again
