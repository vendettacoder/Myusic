heart of gold heart of gold heart of gold
one body in my mother's belly 
chinese dolls, box in boxes
how do you sail the ship from the bottle?
how do you sail the ship from the bottle?
heart of gold heart of gold heart of gold
gold, gold mother, gold, gold, gold mother


i can see the head now
between her legs now
purple headed alien
water logged old man
in the blood silence
in the blood silence
silence, silence


cry for me mother cry for me mother crimean mother cry me another
my feet and hands won't work
my feet and hands won't work
in my baby's body
my brand new baby's body
i'll suck my fingers red
i'll suck my fingers red
in my baby's body
my brand new baby's body


i can see the head now
between her legs now
purple headed alien
water logged old man
in the blood silence
in the blood silence
silence
silence
silence
shut up


in the bright lights and harsh sounds, there's a man
in green ceremonial robes and mask, dipping a straw through your nose
mouthwash of meconium lungs full of meconium
heart full of meconium
meconium
meconium
chinese dolls in boxes
chinese dolls in boxes


i'll go out the same way i came in
chinese dolls in boxes
and everything you touch
and everything you love
and everything you touch
turns to gold
as precious as
as rich as
as dear as
as strong as
as hard as
gold
mother
past the boudaries of all pain
you journey to the edge of death in search of a child
gold mother there's only one
gold mother and she's mine
she's all mine
shut up let's hear it
shut up
