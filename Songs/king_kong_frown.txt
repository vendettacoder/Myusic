i saw a pattern
on a china plate
and the train of thought it triggered off
got me in a state
just a crack of sunlight
in the shape of a heart
a real work of art

so now you think i've lost it
what was left of the plot
you think i'm going to start spreading the news
well i tell you i'm not
there's no hallelujahs
i just killed that clown

with the king kong frown
with the king kong frown

you told me one day
the wind will change
and if i don't watch out
my face is gonna stay this way
well darlin' i won't let you down
i was only joking, just messin' around
with the king kong frown
with the king kong frown

well they took me off the empire state
and they put me in a cage
they locked me up and left me there
with a female half my age

is it any wonder
it kind of wore me out?
i was looking for rain clouds
and then the sun came out
now i've got nothing
to complain about
i got you babe
and the boys in the lounge

and no king kong frown
no king kong frown
no king kong frown
no king kong frown

and all the white boys sing
doo, de doo
