i started to write this song about you
and then i decided that i would write it all about love
and it appeared to me
that you wasn't happy
and that's for sure, positively
that's what the world is made of

so give me more l-o-v-e, love
love is a walk down main street (oh love)
love is an apple that is so sweet (love)
love is something that can't be beat (love)
l-o-v-e is strange to me, oh

i can't explain this feeling
can't you see that salvation is freeing
it's all in the heavens, can't you see
you can always depend on me

to give you love
love is a flower in my soul (oh love)
love is a story that just can't be told (love)
can't you feel it burning more and more (love)
stop and look at the big wheel roll

i can't explain this feeling
can't you see that salvation is freeing
i would give my life for the glory
just to be able to tell the story
about love

i didn't mean to make you mad
a sweet story, i thought i had
but maybe time will bring us together
and i can be such a happy fella

about love
love is something that is so divine (oh love)
love is a feeling that's a friend of mine (love)
it can't be measured by no sign (love)
in your heart or even in your mind
about love, love is as bright as the morning sun
