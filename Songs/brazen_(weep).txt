i called you brazen
called you whore right to your face
and watched you silently
and publicly disgraced
i didn't notice
when you strengthened like a vice
that you were trembling
and burned beneath the ice

ooh, ooh

why don't you weep
when i hurt you? 
why don't you weep
when i cut you? 
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside
why don't you weep
when i hurt you? 
why don't you weep
when i cut you? 
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside

nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah

you said a prayer
and i betrayed you with a kiss
you never realized 
that all had come to this
so keep your dignity
don't throw it all to waste
stronger feelings
than you've ever learned to face

ooh, ooh

why don't you weep
when i hurt you?
why don't you weep
when i cut you?
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside
why don't you weep
when i hurt you?
why don't you weep
when i cut you?
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside

nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah
oooooh

why don't you weep
when i hurt you?
why don't you weep
when i cut you?
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside
oh why don't you weep
when i hurt you?
why don't you weep
when i cut you?
you don't bleed
and the anger builds up inside

oooh
(nah nah nah nah nah)
why don't you weep?
why don't you weep?
why don't you weep?
why don't you weep?
why don't you weep?
why don't you weep?

weep
weep
weep
