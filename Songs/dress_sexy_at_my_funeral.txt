dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
for the first time in your life
wear your blouse undone to here
and your skirt split up to there

oh dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
for the first time in your life
dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
wink at the minister
blow kisses to my grieving brothers

dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
and when it comes your turn to speak before the crowd
tell them about the time we did it
on the beach with fireworks above us

on the railroad tracks with the gravel in your back
in the back room of a crowded bar
and in the very graveyard where my body now rests

oh dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
dress sexy at my funeral my good wife
for the first time in your life

also tell them about how i gave to charity
and tried to love my fellow man as best i could
but most of all don't forget about the time on the beach
with fireworks above us
