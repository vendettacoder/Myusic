they do it down on camber sands, they do it at waikiki   
lazing about the beach all day, at night the crickets creepy   
squinting faces at the sky, a harold robbins paperback   
surfers drop their boards and dry, and everybody wants a hack

but behind the chalet, my holiday's complete
and i feel like william tell
maid marian on her tiptoed feet
pulling mussels from a shell
pulling mussels from a shell

shrinking in the sea so cold, topless ladies look away   
a he-man in a sudden shower shelters from the rain   
you wish you had a motorboat to pose around the harbor bar   
and when the sun goes off to bed, you hook it up behind the car 

but behind the chalet, my holiday's complete
and i feel like william tell
maid marian on her tiptoed feet
pulling mussels from a shell
pulling mussels from a shell   

two fat ladies window shop, something for the mantelpiece   
in for bingo, all the nines, a panda for sweet little niece   
coach drivers stand about, looking at a local map   
about the boy, he's gone away, down to next door's caravan

but behind the chalet, my holiday's complete
and i feel like william tell
maid marian on her tiptoed feet
pulling mussels from a shell
pulling mussels from a shell

but behind the chalet, my holiday's complete
and i feel like william tell
maid marian on her tiptoed feet
pulling mussels from a shell
pulling mussels from a shell
