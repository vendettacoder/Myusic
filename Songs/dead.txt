i returned a bag of groceries accidentally taken off the shelf before the expiration date,
i came back as a bag of groceries accidentally taken off the shelf before the date stamped on myself.
did a large procession wave their torches as my head fell in the basket, and was everybody dancing on the casket?
now it's over, i'm dead and i haven't done anything that i want, or i'm still alive and there's nothing i want to do.

i will never say the word 'procrastinate' again; i'll never see myself in the mirror with my eyes closed.
i didn't apologize for when i was eight and i made my younger brother have to be my personal slave.

so i won't sit at home anymore and you won't see my head in the window, and i won't be around ever anymore,
and i'll be up there on the wall at the store.
