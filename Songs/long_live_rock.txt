down at the astoria the scene was changing
bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating
we were the first band to vomit in the bar
and find the distance to the stage too far
meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
rock is dead they say
long live rock

long live rock, i need it every night
long live rock, come on and join the line
long live rock, be it dead or alive

people walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
we put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
jack is in the alley selling tickets made in hong kong
promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
back in the pub the governor stops the clock
rock is dead, they say
long live rock

long live rock, i need it every night
long live rock, come on and join the line
long live rock, be it dead or alive

landslide, rocks are falling
falling down 'round our very heads
we tried but you were yawning
look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead

the place is really jumping to the high-watt amps
'til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
in the blackout they dance right into the aisle
and as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
rock is dead, they say
long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

long live rock, i need it every night
long live rock, come on and join the line
long live rock, be it dead or alive
