how many special people change
how many lives are living strange
where were you while we were getting high
slowly walking down the hall
faster than a cannon ball
where were you while we were getting high

some day you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova in the sky
some day you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the sky

wake up the dawn and ask her why
a dreamer dreams she never dies
wipe that tear away now from your eye
slowly walking down the hall
faster than a cannon ball
where were you while we were getting high

some day you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova in the sky
some day you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova

'cause people believe
that they're gonna get away for the summer
but you and i, we live and die
the world's still spinning round, we don't know why
why, why, why, why
