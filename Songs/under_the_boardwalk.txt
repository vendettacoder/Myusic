oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
and your shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fireproof
under the boardwalk, down by the sea
on a blanket with my baby is where i'll be

(under the boardwalk) out of the sun
(under the boardwalk) we'll be havin' some fun
(under the boardwalk) people walking above
(under the boardwalk) we'll be making love
under the boardwalk, boardwalk

from the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
mmm, you can almost taste the peanuts and popcorn they sell
under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
on a blanket with my baby is where i'll be

(under the boardwalk) out of the sun
(under the boardwalk) we'll be havin' some fun
(under the boardwalk) people walking above
(under the boardwalk) we'll be making love
under the boardwalk, boardwalk

oh, under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
on a blanket with my baby is where i'll be

(under the boardwalk) out of the sun
(under the boardwalk) we'll be havin' some fun
(under the boardwalk) people walking above
(under the boardwalk) we'll be making in love
under the boardwalk, boardwalk
