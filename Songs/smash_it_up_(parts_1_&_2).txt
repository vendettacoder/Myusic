we've been crying now for much too long
and now we're gonna dance to a different song
i'm gonna scream and shout 'til my dying breath
i'm gonna smash it up 'til there's nothing left

oooh, ooh, smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
oooh, ooh, smash it up, smash it up, smash it up

people call me villain, oh, it's such a shame
maybe its my clothes must be to blame
i don't even care if i look a mess
don't wanna be a sucker like all the rest

oooh, ooh, smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
oooh, ooh, smash it up, smash it up, smash it up

smash it up
smash it up
smash it up
smash it up
smash it up

smash it up, you can keep your krishna burgers
smash it up, and your glastonbury hippies
smash it up, you can stick your frothy lager
smash it up and your blow wave hairstyles

and everybody's smashing things down
i said everybody's smashing things down, yeah
