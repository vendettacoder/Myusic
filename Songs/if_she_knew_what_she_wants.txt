ooooh

if she knew what she wants
(he'd be giving it to her)
if she knew what she needs
(he could give her that too)
if she knew what she wants
(but he can't see through her)
if she knew what she wants
he'd be giving it to her
giving it to her

but she wants everything
(he can pretend to give her everything)
or there's nothing she wants
(she don't want to sort it out)
he's crazy for this girl
(but she don't know what she's looking for)
if she knew what she wants
he'd be giving it to her
giving it to her

i'd say her values are corrupted
but she's open to change
then one day she's satisfied
and the next i'll find her crying
and it's nothing she can explain

if she knew what she wants
(he'd be giving it to her)
if she knew what she needs
(he could give her that too)
if she knew what she wants
(but he can't see through her)
if she knew what she wants
he'd be giving it to her
giving it to her (giving it to her)

some have a style
that they work hard to refine
so they walk a crooked line
but she won't understand
why anyone would have to try
to walk a line when they could fly

no sense thinking i could rehabilitate her
when she's fine, fine, fine
she's got so many ideas traveling around in her head
she doesn't need nothing from mine

if she knew what she wants
(he'd be giving it to her)
if she knew what she needs
(he'd be givin' it too)
if she knew what she wants
(but he can't see through her)
if she knew what she wants
he'd be giving it to her
giving it to her

but she wants everything
(he can pretend to give her everything)
or there's nothing she wants
(she don't want to sort it out)
he's crazy for this girl
(but she don't know what she's looking for)
if she knew what she wants
he'd be giving it to her
giving it to her

(he'd be giving it to her)
(he could give her that too)
(but he can't see through her)
ooooooh, giving it to her
giving it to her now
