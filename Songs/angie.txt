angie, angie
when will those clouds all disappear?
angie, angie
where will it lead us from here?

with no lovin' in our souls
and no money in our coats
you can't say we're satisfied
but angie, angie
you can't say we never tried

angie, you're beautiful, yeah
but ain't it time we said goodbye?
angie, i still love ya
remember all those nights we cried?

all the dreams we held so close
seemed to all go up in smoke
let me whisper in your ear
angie, angie
where will it lead us from here?

oh, angie, don't you weep
all your kisses still taste sweet
i hate that sadness in your eyes
but, angie (wooh), angie
ain't it time we said goodbye, yeah?

with no lovin' in our souls
and no money in our coats
you can't say we're satisfied
but angie, i still love you, baby
everywhere i look, i see your eyes
there ain't a woman that comes close to you
come on, baby, dry your eyes

but angie, angie
ain't it good to be alive?
angie, angie
they can't say we never tried
