take out the papers and the trash
or you don't get no spendin' cash
if you don't scrub that kitchen floor
you ain't gonna rock and roll no more
yakety yak (don't talk back)

just finish cleanin' up your room
let's see that dust fly with that broom
get all that garbage out of sight
or you don't go out friday night
yakety yak (don't talk back)

you just put on your coat and hat
and walk yourself to the laundromat
and when you finish doin' that
bring in the dog and put out the cat
yakety yak (don't talk back)

don't you give me no dirty looks
your father's hip, he knows what cooks
just tell your hoodlum friend outside
you ain't got time to take a ride
yakety yak (don't talk back)

yakety yak, yakety yak
yakety yak, yakety yak
yakety yak, yakety yak
