ahhhhh...
wjbs, on your radio dial
with the morning of the fox, that rocks the box
expect sunshine today!
for yesterday's rain has faded far away
now we seek a brand new day, a brand new way
learn my brothers and sisters, learn

(mike g)
nighttime fades away, on to the next day
the weatherman predicts a clear sunny saturday
relax laid back and feelin the cool breeze
positive vibes in sauce and the melodies
gather my leaves and all my minerals
fix myself a bowl of vegetables
ice cold water and chopped up fruits
gonna be a long day so i throw on my boots
stretch out my hut and beyond the sun rises
clouds gather round and suddenly hides it
doubled back cause it started pourin
children scared of the thunder roarin
given the light but now there's darkness
started with intelligence, now there's ignorance
negative vibes now i don't feel right
i want my sunshine, i want my sunlight
same old story, over and over
somebody tryin to take knowledge over
so i fight back with a native dance
sing my song and chant my chants
