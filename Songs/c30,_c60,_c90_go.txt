every day i get a brand new show
off tv, record and radio
i breeze with the sleaze on my cassette
'cause i got the affirmative magnolia, man!

c30, c60, c90, go!
c30, c60, c90, go!
c-3-0, c-6-0
c30, c60, c90, go!
c90, go, 3-0, 6-0, 9-0, go!

a bit bam-boogie and a booga-rooga
my cassette's just like a bazooka
a bligger, a blagger, a blippity-blop
well, i'm going down to the record shop
yeah!

and the boss said
"lp, single, picture cover or plain?
i've got all the hits and all the big names
i've got biggest discounts in my store
and if you buy three records, i'll give you four"

c30, c60, c90, go
off the radio i get a constant flow
hit it, pause it, record it and play
turn it, rewind, and rub it away

c30, c60, c90, go!
c30, c60, c90, go!
c30, c60, c90, go!
c-3-0, c-6-0
c30, c60, c90, go!
c90, go, 3-0, 6-0, 9-0, go!

it used to break my heart when i went in your shop
and you say my records were out of stock
so i don't buy records in your shop
now i tape them all, 'cause i'm top of the pops!
yeah!

now i got a new way to move
it's shiny and black and don't need a groove
well, i don't need no album rack
i carry my collection over my back

c30, c60, c90, go
off the radio i get a constant flow
hit it, pause it, record it and play
turn it, rewind, and rub it away

policeman stopped me in my tracks
said "hey, you, you can't tape that
you're under arrest 'cause it's illegal"
so i shoved him off and blew his whistle
i'm a pirate and i keep my loot
so i blew him out with my bazooka

c30, c60, c90, go
off the radio i get a constant flow
hit it, pause it, record it and play
turn it, rewind, and rub it away

you're rich enough to have a record collection
i'll bring my bazooka round for inspection

sometimes it's better get hit twice as fast
so i press my playback to make it last
i breeze with the sleaze on my cassette
i've got the affirmative magnolia, now!

c30, c60, c90, go
off the radio i get a constant flow
hit it, pause it, record it and play
turn it, rewind, and rub it away

c30, c60, c90, go!
c30, c60, c90, go!
c30, c60, c90, go!
c-3-0, c-6-0
c30, c60, c90, go!
c90, go, 3-0, 6-0, 9-0, go!
