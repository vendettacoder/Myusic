there's been a lot of talk of love
but that don't amount to nothing
you can evolve the stars above
but that doesn't make it something

and the only way to last
and the only way to live it
is to hold on when you get love,
and let go when you give it.. give it.

it's a pretty melody
it might help you through the night time
but it doesn't make it easy
to leave the party at the right time

if i'm frightened, if i'm high
it's my weakness please forgive it
at least i hold on when i get love,
and i let go when i give it

what do i do when i get lonely?
what do i do?
hold on when you get love,
what do i do when i get lonely?
what do i do?
let go when you give it
what do i do?

the world won't listen to this song
and the radio won't play it
but if you like it sing along
sing 'cause you don't know how to say it

take the weakest thing in you
and then beat the bastards with it
and always hold on when you get love,
so you can let go when you give it

take the weakest thing in you
and then beat the bastards with it
and always hold on when you get love,
so you can let go when you give it.. give it.. give it.

what do i do when i get lonely?
what do i do?
hold on when you get love,
what do i do when i get lonely?
what do i do?
and let go when you give love
what do i do when i get lonely?
what do i do?
hold on when you get love,
what do i do?

i know it's true, please don't think i do
nothing that you say or do will make you love me
forget the song, things will go on
i keep seeing you from the dark with you above me

i know it's true, please don't think i do
nothing that you say or do will make you love me
forget the song, things will go on
i keep seeing you from the dark with you above me

take the weakest thing in you
and then beat the bastards with it
and always hold on when you get love,
so you can let go when you give it.
give it.. give it.. give it.. give it.. give it.. give it.
