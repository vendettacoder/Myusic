i'd love to comb your hair

i don't like my hair neat
i don't like my hair neat
i don't like my hair neat

you've nothing left to lose 
just take off your shoes

the shoes stay on my feet (on my feet)
the shoes stay on my feet (on my feet)
the shoes stay on my feet

i'd like to hold your hand
wearing my brand new gloves
this must be real love
i'd love to hold your hand

those gloves don't touch my skin
those gloves don't touch my skin
those gloves don't touch my skin
those gloves don't touch my skin

i'd love to do your nails
before someone gets hurt
don't be such a flirt
i'd love to do those nails

these nails have served me well
these nails have served me well
these nails have served me well
these nails have served me well

what's that sound?
i like that sound
i love that sound
it's the sound of my shoes

what's that sound?
i like that sound
i love that sound
it's the sound of my shoes
