a friend in need's a friend indeed; a friend with weed is better
a friend with breasts and all the rest, a friend who's dressed in leather
a friend in need's a friend indeed; a friend who'll tease is better 
our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed, and makes for stormy weather

(dawning... crawling...
dawning...)

a friend in need's a friend indeed; my japanese is better
and when she's pressed she will undress, and then she's boxing clever
a friend in need's a friend indeed; a friend who bleeds is better
my friend confessed she passed the test and we will never sever

days dawning, skins crawling
days dawning, skins crawling
days dawning, skins crawling
days dawning, skins crawling
pure morning, pure morning
pure morning, pure morning
(morning... morning...
morning...)
