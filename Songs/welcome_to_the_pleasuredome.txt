the world is my oyster........

life goes on day after day

who-ha who-ha

the animals are winding me up
the jungle call
the jungle call
who-ha who-ha who-ha who-ha
in xanadu did kublai khan
a pleasuredome erect
moving on keep moving on-yeah
moving at one million miles an hour
using my power
i sell it by the hour
i have it so i market it
you really can't afford it-yeah
really can't afford it

*shooting stars never stop
even when they reach the top
shooting stars never stop
even when they reach the top

**there goes a supernova
what a pushover-yeah
there goes a supernova
what a pushover

***we're a long way from home
welcome to the pleasuredome
on our way home
going home where lovers roam
long way from home
welcome to the pleasuredome

moving on keep moving on
i will give you diamonds by the shower
love your body even when it's old
do it just as only i can do it
and never ever doing what i'm told

*(repeat)

**(repeat)

we're a long way from home
welcome to the pleasuredome
on our way home
going home where lovers roam
welcome to the pleasuredome

keep moving on
got to reach the top
don't stop
pay love and life-oh my
keep moving on
on again-yeah

shooting stars never stop
shooting stars never stop

****shooting stars never stop
even when they reach the top
there goes a supernova
what a pushover

****(repeat)

who-ha who-ha
welcome to the pleasuredome
who-ha who-ha
going home where lovers roam
welcome to the pleasuredome
