well i want better than you can give
but then i'll take whatever you got
cos i'm a grand libertine with the
kinda demeanour to overthrow the lot

(ate what?) desire is so voracious
i wanna eat your nation state

i got incentive that you can't handle
i got the needs you can't assuage
i got demands you can't meet
'n' stay on your feet
i want more then your living wage
