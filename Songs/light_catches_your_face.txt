the dog-eared disprin in your handbag
a gathering of crumbs and twenty fags
i'd steal some chewing gum, a few stray coins
i'm sure you noticed but didn't much mind

h-oh
and so it goes
h-oh

here i am, in the condiment aisle
i'm worried about my basil from isreal and new world wine
i need to lose these poses, reset my charms
to when i left the factory in your arms

singing h-oh
h-oh
and so it goes

but the words on the page start to swim
as light catches your face, you're smiling
this must be what all the fuss is about

h-oh
h-oh
h-oh

you're trying to talk to me, all grateful and smiles
i'm glued to the tv, giving one-word replies
it's small and shameful, it's a poor show
beat myself up on the way home and go crying to my girl

and so it goes
yeah, so it goes
yeah, so it goes

but the words on the page start to swim
as light catches your face, you're smiling
this must be what all the fuss is about

but the words on the page start to swim
as light catches your face, you're smiling
