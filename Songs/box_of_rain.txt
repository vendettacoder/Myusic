look out of any window
any morning, any evening, any day
maybe the sun is shining
birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

what do you want me to do
to do for you to see you through?
for this is all a dream we dreamed
one afternoon long ago

walk out of any doorway
feel your way, feel your way like the day before
maybe you'll find direction
around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

what do you want me to do
to watch for you while you're sleeping?
then please don't be surprised
when you find me dreaming, too

look into any eyes you find by you
you can see clear to another day
maybe been seen before
through other eyes on other days while going home

what do you want me to do
to do for you to see you through?
it's all a dream we dreamed
one afternoon long ago

walk into splintered sunlight
inch your way through dead dreams to another land
maybe you're tired and broken
your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear

what do you want me to do
to do for you to see you through?
a box of rain will ease the pain
and love will see you through

just a box of rain, wind and water
believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on
sun and shower, wind and rain
in and out the window like a moth before a flame

and it's just a box of rain, i don't know who put it there
believe it if you need it or leave it if you dare
and it's just a box of rain or a ribbon for your hair
such a long, long time to be gone and a short time to be there
