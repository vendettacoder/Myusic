i won't cry
anyone would rather
shift their eyes
than open up their leather
but you, you seem to be the one

so try me please
i'm a better dancer
than it seems
the lightest floating feather
is how i feel when i'm with you

so now that i know you
i'm ready to show you
how good i feel
'cause anyone can see through me
but you're not anyone

blaring car horns howl
through feedback from this city
but i don't hear it now
the chaos that surrounds me
nou, you hold my mind's desire

you give me shelter
from all that's done un-pretty
my sold-out, felt-up
retreated little secrets
are tucked inside the warmth of you

so now that i know you
i'm ready to show you
how good i feel
'cause anyone can see through me
but you're not anyone

it's been a long time, a long time
i've walked alone, i've warmed to it
but now i slip right in
i'm ready to start to be ready

so hold me now
you who came in pieces
'cause i like whole pies
underdone a little
but i feel how you burn inside

so now that i know you
i'm so ready to show you
how good i feel
'cause anyone can see through me
but you're not anyone

anyone can see through me
but you're not anyone

anyone can see through me
but you're not anyone
