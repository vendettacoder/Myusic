baby's on fire
better throw her in the water
look at her laughing
like a heifer to the slaughter
baby's on fire
and all the laughing boys are bitching
waiting for photos
oh the plot is so bewitching
rescuers row row
do your best to change the subject
blow the wind, blow, blow
lend some assistance to the object
photographers snip snap
take your time she's only burning
this kind of experience
is necessary for her learning
if you'll be my flotsam
i could be half the man i used to
they said you were hot stuff
and that's what baby's been reduced to

juanita and juan
very clever with maracas
making their fortunes
selling second-hand tobaccos
juan dances at chico's
and when the clients are evicted
he empties the ashtrays
and pockets all that he's collected
but baby's on fire
and all the instruments agree that
her temperature's rising
but any idiot would know that
