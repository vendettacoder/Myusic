ought to know what i liar i am
ought to know me by now
don't curse me for my nature
don't blast me for my wrongs
just a bad penny
i always come back to you
just a bad penny

just a bad penny
i always come back to you
should have known you couldn't trust me
as far as you could throw me, throw me
you couldn't throw me to far
just a bad penny
couldn't throw me to far

i think i fucked your girlfriend once
maybe twice, i don't remember
then i fucked all your friend's girlfriends
now they hate you

just a bad penny
just a bad penny
such a bad penny
a bad bad penny

ought to know what i liar i am
ought to know me by now
such a bad penny
a bad bad penny
ought to know what i liar i am
ought to know me by now
ought to know you couldn't trust me
as far as you could throw me, throw me
such a bad penny
such a bad penny
slap my hand
