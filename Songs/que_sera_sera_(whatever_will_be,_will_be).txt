when i was just a little girl
i asked my mother, what will i be?
will i be pretty? will i be rich?
here's what she said to me

que sera, sera
whatever will be, will be
the future's not ours to see
que sera, que sera, que sera, que sera

when i grew up and fell in love
i asked my lover what lies ahead?
will there be rainbows day after day?
here's what my lover said

que sera, sera
whatever will be, will be
the future's not ours to see
que sera, que sera, que sera, que sera

que sera, sera
whatever will be, will be
the future's not ours to see
que sera, que sera, que sera, que sera
