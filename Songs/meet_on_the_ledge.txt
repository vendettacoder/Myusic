we used to say "there'd come the day we'd all be making songs 
or finding better words" these ideas never lasted long 

the way is up along the road, the air is growing thin 
too many friends who tried, blown off this mountain with the wind 

meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge 
when my time is up, i'm going to see all my friends 
meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge 
if you really mean it, it all comes around again 

yet now i see, i'm all alone, but that's the only way to be 
you'll have your chance again, then you can do the work for me 

meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge 
when my time is up, i'm going to see all my friends 
meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge 
if you really mean it, it all comes around again 
meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge 
when my time is up, i'm going to see all my friends 
meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge 
if you really mean it, it all comes around again
