i go to a club on the saturday nights
i order a vodka to make me feel right
the place is packed
dancing couples everywhere
i take a seat in the corner and stare

suddenly i see
you're dancing too
your hips are shaking
i dont know what to do
i wanna talk to you
but my mouth is dry,
oh why am i so shy

yabadabaday yoboboboboy
i wanna be your disco boy
i wanna dance with you and i hold you tight
i wanna make you mine tonight

i'm heading to the bar to have another drink
yes, i need a drink and some time to think
five vodkas later i had a plan
i know i must be brave and act like a man

like a bridge

come and i falling to the trance
people come closer to see my discodance
come closer to and keep me in view
all i'm singing this just for you

yabadabaday yoboboboboy
i wanna be your disco boy
i wanna dance with you and i hold you tight
i wanna make you mine tonight
