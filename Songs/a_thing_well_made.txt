she's wearing her don't talk to me face
as she makes the kids lunches
i oblige and quietly shut the front door as i leave
i drive into town before the fog lifts
i sell sporting goods
'cause i've got a shop not far from cathedral square

i like to open up early
so fellas can come in on their way to work
and daydream around the rods and reels
while their breakfast's still warm inside them
go on have yourselves a look
i'm proud of my shop
almost everything's from overseas
you won't find a better selection

look at the way this gun fits the crook of your arm
to make a thing like that you'd need to know what you were about
you'd need to know where you were going
and go there in a straight line
and everything else you'd have to shut right out
can you see the man who made that
can you see him putting it down and standing back
can you see the moment when he said
that's it
that's perfect

at a time like that
you wouldn't care about your job
or your mortgage
or the fight you had with your wife 'cause
when a man holds a thing well made
when a man holds a thing well made
there's connection
there's completeness
when a man holds a thing well made
when a man holds a thing well made
when a man holds a thing well made
when a man holds a thing well made

it's wednesday
so i do the mail orders
there's nothing much
some oilskins and a 303
for a hunter over in westland
and oh yeah
one of those ak-47s
for some collector down the line
