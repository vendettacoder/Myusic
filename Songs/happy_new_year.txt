did the ironing in a cowboy hat
felt as fresh as the paint in this new flat
i will never tell you what to do
have ambition simply to see things through
did you know i could be a lot of fun
i'm aware that friendship can die young
as the glow from the street light bled
down the langlands road we set off the best of friends

i know where i stand (i know just where i stand)
i don't need you to hold my hand

well, i've tried to get along with you
i have asked myself what are we gonna do?
i'm coming round to take a stand
going to put us together with glue or an elastic band

i know where i stand (i know just where i stand)
i don't need you to hold my hand

i am softer than my face would suggest
at times like these i'm at my lowest ebb
and now i can confide in you
if i cry to set the mood oh please could you cry too

happy new year, you are my only vice
what if we compromised? i am open
happy new year, you are my only vice
(do you have to wear a frown like that?
you could have hit me with a baseball bat)
what if we compromised? i am open
(do you have to wear a frown like that?
you could have hit me with a baseball bat)
do you want to? (yes i do) do you have to? (so do you)
do you want to? (so do you) do you have to?
