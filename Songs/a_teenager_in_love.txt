each time we have a quarrel
it almost breaks my heart
'cause i'm so afraid
that we will have to part

each night i ask the stars up above
why must i be a teenager in love?

one day i feel so happy
next day i feel so sad
i guess i'll learn to take
the good with the bad

'cause each night i ask the stars up above
why must i be a teenager in love?

i cried a tear
for nobody but you
i'll be a lonely one
if you should say we're through

well, if you want to make me cry
that won't be so hard to do
if you should say goodbye
i'll still go on loving you

each night i ask the stars up above
why must i be a teenager in love?

i cried a tear
for nobody but you
i'll be a lonely one
if you should say we're through

well, if you want to make me cry
that won't be so hard to do
and if you should say goodbye
i'll still go on loving you

each night i ask the stars up above
why must i be a teenager in love?
(in love) why must i be a teenager in love?
(in love) why must i be a teenager in love?
(in love) why must i be a teenager in love?
