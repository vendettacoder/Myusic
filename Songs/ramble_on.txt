the leaves are falling all around, time i was on my way
thanks to you, i'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
but now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
for now i smell the rain, and with it, pain
and it's headed my way
ah, sometimes i grow so tired
but i know i've got one thing i got to do

ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
to sing my song, i'm goin' 'round the world, i gotta find my girl
on my way, i've been this way ten years to the day
ramble on, i gotta find the queen of all my dreams

got no time for spreadin' roots, the time has come to be gone
and though our health we drank a thousand times
it's time to ramble on

ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
sing my song, i'm goin' 'round the world, i gotta find my girl
on my way, i've been this way ten years to the day
i gotta ramble on, i gotta find the queen of all my dreams

i tell you no lie

mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom i hold dear
how years ago in days of old when magic filled the air
'twas in the darkest depths of mordor, i met a girl so fair
but gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
and ain't nothin' i can do, no

i guess i'll keep on ramblin', i'm gonna shake.
sing my song, i've gotta find my baby
i'm gonna ramble on, sing my song, work my way, goin' 'round the world, baby, baby
ramble on, yeah

ah doo doo doo doo doo, my baby
ah doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

i can't stop this feelin' in my heart
everytime i think about my babe, i really got to part
gotta keep searchin' for my baby/
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe

yeah, i gotta keep searchin' for my baby
yeah, i gotta keep a-searchin' for my baby
