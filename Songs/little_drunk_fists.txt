little drunk fists across the tip of my chin
guess i shoulda known that they'd be there again

little drunk fists across the width of my jaw
gets sometimes to where i just don't feel them at all
...
(chorus)
that's okay: i can wait another day
for these stupid concessions to be made: (and)
you weren't to blame
we put jack and johnny walker's names
in the policeman's notebook when he came
...
little drunk fists need some time to their own
went out to meet some friends but ended up all alone

little drunk fists find and pick up a phone
but fumble on the numbers when they try to dial home

(repeat chorus)

little drunk fists raise for just one more round
end up buying six when the fifth hits the ground

and little baby fists touch my face, clutch my nose
though they'd rather touch their mother's,
but she don't know
...
little drunk fists drove the car home last night
turned left on oak street 
when they should have turned right...
