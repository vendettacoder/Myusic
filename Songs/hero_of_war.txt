he said "son, have you seen the world?
well, what would you say if i said that you could?
just carry this gun, you'll even get paid."
i said "that sounds pretty good."

black leather boots
spit-shined so bright
they cut off my hair but it looked alright
we marched and we sang
we all became friends
as we learned how to fight

a hero of war
yeah that's what i'll be
and when i come home
they'll be damn proud of me
i'll carry this flag
to the grave if i must
'cause it's a flag that i love
and a flag that i trust

i kicked in the door
i yelled my commands
the children, they cried
but i got my man
we took him away
a bag over his face
from his family and his friends

they took off his clothes
they pissed in his hands
i told them to stop
but then i joined in
we beat him with guns
and batons not just once
but again and again

a hero of war
yeah that's what i'll be
and when i come home
they'll be damn proud of me
i'll carry this flag
to the grave if i must
'cause it's a flag that i love
and a flag that i trust

she walked through bullets and haze
i asked her to stop
i begged her to stay
but she pressed on
so i lifted my gun
and i fired away

and the shells jumped through the smoke
and into the sand
that the blood now had soaked
she collapsed with a flag in her hand
a flag white as snow

a hero of war
is that what they see
just medals and scars
so damn proud of me
and i brought home that flag
now it gathers dust
but it's a flag that i love
it's the only flag i trust

he said, "son, have you seen the world?
well what would you say, if i said that you could?"
