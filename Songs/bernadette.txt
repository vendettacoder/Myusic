people are searching for
the kind of love that we possess
some go on
searching their whole life through
and never find the love i found in you

and when i speak of you
i see envy in other men's eyes
and i'm well aware of what's on their minds
they pretend to be my friend, when all the time (sweet bernadette)
they long to persuade you from my side (sweet bernadette)
they'd give the world and all they own
for just one moment we have known

bernadette
they want you because
of the pride that it gives
but bernadette
i want you because
i need you to live

but while i live only to hold you
some other men, they long to control you
but how can they control you, bernadette (sweet bernadette)
when they can not control themselves, bernadette (sweet bernadette)
from wanting you, needing you
but darling, you belong to me

i'll tell the world, you belong to me
i tell the world, you're the soul of me
i tell the world, you're a part of me
bernadette

in your arms i find the kind of peace of mind
the world is searching for
but you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
has always been longing for

in you i have what other men long for
all men need someone to worship and adore
that's why i treasure you and place you high above
for the only joy in life is to be loved
so whatever you do, bernadette

keep on loving me
bernadette, keep on needing me
bernadette

bernadette
you're the soul of me
more than a dream, you're a plan to me
and bernadette, you mean more to me
than a woman was ever meant to be

bernadette
my darling, bernadette
