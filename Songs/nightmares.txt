[chorus: bilal]
i'm having nightmares...ooohhh
my niggaz say i'm p-noid, they say i'm just p-noid..
i'm having nightmares...ooohhh
my niggaz say i'm p-noid, they say i'm just p-noid..

[bilal:]
i'm waking up in the middle of the night
my heart beats' pumping like something ain't right
oh whats goin on...
when i go outside i feel something behind me
i'm looking back, but nothing's around me
oh whats goin on..
man i don't know, what am i trippin on
theirs something in the room, its lerking in the shadow
staring through the darkness.....man i don't know
these four walls are closing in, these voices ain't my friend
their haunting me, those, those memories

[chorus]

[malice:]
yea,
they coming for me, they running up
i'm on my balcony, seeing through the eyes of tony
they say we homies, but i see hatred
do not they know brotherly-love is sacred
niggaz catch feelings, even contemplate killings
when you see millions, their are many chamillions
your not a gunna, for real, your just a runna
haters i spot you from a far, and i'm the deer hunter
they be thinking nice car, nice crib
i be thinking, how long will these niggaz let me live
i understand, cause people need things
and they will take it from you, and take you from your seedlings
so even with the mumble is talk,
i still walk the most humblest walk
and one day, they may even catch up with me man
but til then, i'm leonardo, catch me if you can

[chorus]

[bilal:]
look over your shoulder, something is near
and i'm so scared, when i'm alone i'm so scared
now it's inching closer, trouble is near
but nothing's there, when i look nothing's there
i'm outta my mind, i'm running from guilt, but..
its right by my side, theirs nowhere to hide..
i'm outta my mind, i'm running from guilt, but..
its right by my side, theirs nowhere to hide ..

[pusha t:]
i make big money, drive big cars
everybody know me, it's like i'm a movie star
virginia nights, sellin hard white
to sellin out shows, every gangsta love my flow
still i creep low, thinking niggaz trying to harm me
hoping my karma ain't coming back here to haunt me
was it that nigga, i took his powder with a smile
praying to lord, the gun ain't pop and hit the child, shit
i pilt niggaz girls back like alphahydroxie
spent money like happy days, i'm the real fonzy
top off the coupe, thats how jfk got shot b,
can't let niggaz roll up beside me, and 2pac me
holla if you hear me, tears flowing sincerely
check up on my block, weekly, my health yearly
somethings wrong with me, niggaz don't get along with me
got a 4-4, hope ya body got strong kidneys..oh!
