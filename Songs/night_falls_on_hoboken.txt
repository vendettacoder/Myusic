frightened face, worried dream, break my heart with your sad scream
sun is down, spirits low, hate my impatience and here i go

come on, let's leave our misery
and crawl toward where we want to be
can't we try? can't we try?
come on, sleep one night peacefully
when i'll yawn all day easily
and rest up my mind

weary guise, mine the same, why so worried? you can't explain

come on, let's leave our misery
and crawl toward where we want to be
can't we try? can't we try?
come on, sleep one night peacefully
then i'll yawn all day easily
