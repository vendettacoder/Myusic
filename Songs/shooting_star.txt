johnny was a schoolboy
when he heard his first beatles song
"love me do" i think it was
and from then it didn't take him long

got himself a guitar
used to play every night
now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit
and everything's alright

don't you know?

johnny told his mama
"hey, mama, i'm goin' away
i'm gonna hit the big time
gonna be a big star someday, yeah"

mama came to the door
with a teardrop in her eye
johnny said, "don't cry mama
smile and wave goodbye"

don't you know?
yeah, yeah

don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you know?
don't you know?
don't you know that you are a shooting star?
and all the world will love you just as long
as long as you are

johnny made a record
went straight up to number one
suddenly everyone loved
to hear him sing his song

watchin' the world go by
surprisin' it goes so fast
johnny looked around him and said
"well, i made the big time at last"

don't you know?
now don't you know?

don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you know, whoa, yeah?
don't you know that you are a shooting star, yeah?
and all the world will love you just as long
as long as you are a shooting star

don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you know, ahh?
don't you know that you are a shooting star, now?
and all the world will love you just as long
as long as you are

johnny died one night
died in his bed
bottle of whiskey
sleeping tablets by his head

johnny's life passed him by
like a warm summer day
if you listen to the wind
you can still hear him play

whoa, whoa, whoa
don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you know?
don't you know?
don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you know?
don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you know?
don't you know that you are a shooting star?

don't you, don't you know that you are a shooting star?
don't you, don't you know?
no, no, no, no
no no, no no no, no no no
no no no, no
