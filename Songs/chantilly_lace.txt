hello baby, yeah, this is the big bopper speaking
oh you sweet thing
do i what?
will i what?
oh baby, you know what i like!

chantilly lace
and a pretty face
and a pony tail hanging down
that wiggle in the walk
and giggle in the talk
makes the world go round
there ain't nothing in the world
like a big eyed girl
that makes me act so funny
make me spend my money
make me feel real loose
like a long necked goose
like a girl, oh baby that's what i like!

what's that baby?
but - but - but - oh honey!
but - oh baby you know what i like!

make me spend my money
make me feel real loose
like a long necked goose
like a girl, oh baby that's what i like!

oh, alright baby, you know what i like!
