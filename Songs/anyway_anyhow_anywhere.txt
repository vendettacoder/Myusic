i could go anyway, the way i choose
i could live anyhow, win or lose
i could go anywhere for something new
anyway, anyhow, anywhere i choose

i can do anything, right or wrong
i can talk anyhow to get along
i don't care anyway, i never lose
anyway, anyhow, anywhere i choose

nothing gets in my way, not even locked doors
i don't follow the lines that've been laid before
i get along anyway i dare
anyway anyhow anywhere

i could go anyway, the way i choose
i could live anyhow, win or lose
i can do anything for something new
anyway, anyhow, anywhere i choose

anyway
anyway i choose, yeah
anyway i wanna go
i wanna go and do myself
do myself, do myself, yeah
anyway, the way i choose
anyway i choose, yeah yeah
never gonna lose, the way i choose
the way i choose, the way i choose
