i'm a loser
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be

of all the love i have won or have lost
there is one love i should never have crossed
she was a girl in a million, my friend
i should have known she would win in the end

i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be

although i laugh and i act like a clown
beneath this mask, i am wearing a frown
my tears are falling like rain from the sky
is it for her or myself that i cry?

i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be

what have i done to deserve such a fate?
i realize i have left it too late
and so it's true, pride comes before a fall
i'm telling you so that you won't lose all

i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser
and i'm not what i appear to be
