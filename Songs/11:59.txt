leaning in your corner like a candidate for wax
sidewalk social scientist don't get no satisfaction from your cigarette
it's 10 to 10, time is running out
lock up all your memories, get outta here, you know that we can run

today can last another million years
today could be the end of me
it's 11:59, and i want to stay alive

pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night
take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean
wait until the morning, take tomorrow by the hand
take it down the highway like a rocket to the ocean, we can run

today can last another million years
today could be the end of me
it's 11:59, and i want to stay alive

hanging on a frequency, burning like a fire
boy, you've got the motion down, it's getting late, i'm tired and i've lost control
don't leave me here, time is running out
take me down the highway like a rocket to the ocean, we can run

today can last another million years
today could be the end of me
it's 11:59, and i want to stay alive
