sell me morning sell me day sell me everything
i'll buy all your crazy herbs
and spice the sunshine and the air
sunday morning breathe in my face and i own
the sunlight and the day completely.

sell me evening sell me night sell me starry sky
i'll buy all your crazy moonlight
flicker on a moving sea
milky way poured out on my head and i own
the evening and the stars completely.

you tell me time and time again
you'll give me wine and water
but for the thirty-second time
i want no water with my wine
i want no water with my wine.

sell me heat-haze sell me rain sell me wet and dry
i'll buy all your lazy laughter
scatter magic to the moon
reddened cheeks surrounding the fire and
reflected smiles are cast in brightened eyes.

sell me morning sell me day sell me everything
i'll buy all your crazy herbs
and spice the sunshine and the air
sunday morning breathe in my face and i own
the sunlight and the day completely.

you tell me time and time again
you'll give me wine and water
but for the thirty-second time
i want no water with my wine
i want no water with my wine.
