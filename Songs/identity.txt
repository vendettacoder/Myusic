identity

identity is the crisis can't you see 
identity, identity
when you look in the mirror do you see yourself 
do you see yourself on the t.v. screen 
do you see yourself in the magazine 
when you see yourself does it make you scream

identity is the crisis can't you see 
identity, identity, yeaah



identity is the crisis can't you see 
identity, identity
when you look in the mirror do you smash it quick 
do you take the glass and slash your wrists 
did you do it for fame, did you do it in a fit 
did you do it before you read about it

identity is the crisis can't you see 
identity, identity, yeaah
