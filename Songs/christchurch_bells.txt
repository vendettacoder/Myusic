it's been a long day coming, seems like it'll go on
your window is open to the night and your coffee's still warm
you're feeling good now, looking well
being soothed by the sound of the christchurch bells

as the hours turn, you can hear them
they'll be ringing time

john, he lives in this town, repairs old watches and clocks
they don't give him much time, no, he doesn't know what's gone wrong
he keeps on moving on this lonely road from hell
asking for forgiveness underneath christchurch bells

as the hours turn, you can hear them
they'll be ringing time
still the hours turn, you can hear them
as the time goes by, go by

sunsets over the city, clouds are rising
and you can see clear up to the night time sky
and if you're feeling precious, you want to do well
think of others, ask for a prayer underneath christchurch bells

as the hours turn, you can hear them
they'll be ringing time
still the hours turn, you can hear them
as the time goes by, go by

you can hear them and they're ringing
as the time goes by
