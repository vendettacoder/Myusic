meet me by the coppice stool
before the night takes back its jewels
bring your life of memories
before they sink into the seas

snakes
are coming to your town
in tunnels underground
some traveling overground

a plague for our mistakes
they'll be right next to you
snakes up against me too
there'll be nothing to do
when the rattle shakes

one more glass and then we're dry
say some words, i'll write them down
seal the couplets deep inside

snakes
are coming to your town
in tunnels underground
some traveling overground

a plague for our mistakes
they'll be right next to you
snakes up against me too
there'll be nothing to do
when the rattle shakes
