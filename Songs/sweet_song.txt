what am i to do
someone here is really not happy
put myself on a line
it seems i never got through to you
so i wean myself off slowly

i'm a darkened soul
my streets all pop music and gold
all our lives are on tv
you switch off and try to sleep
people get so lonely

i believe i believe i believe
everything's out to sea
i believe i believe i believe i believe
that is the way it should be
i hope you feel the same

everyone is dying
stop crying now here comes the sun
i didn't mean to hurt you no no no
it takes time to see what you have done
so i wean myself off slowly

i believe i believe i believe
love is the only one
i deceive i deceive i deceive i deceive
cos' i'm not that strong
hope you feel the same

and now it seems that we're falling apart
but i hope i see the good in you come back again
i just believed in you
