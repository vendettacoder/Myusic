please don't dominate the rap, jack
if you've got nothing new to say
if you please, don't back up the track 
this train's got to run today

i spent a little time on the mountain
i spent a little time on the hill
i heard some say, "better run away"
others say, "better stand still"

now i don't know, but i've been told 
it's hard to run with the weight of gold
other hand, i have heard it said
it's just as hard with the weight of lead

who can deny, who can deny
it's not just a change of style?
one step done and another begun
and i wonder how many miles

i spent a little time on the mountain
i spent a little time on the hill
things went down we don't understand
but i think in time we will

now i don't know, but i was told 
in the heat of the sun, a man died of cold
keep on coming or stand and wait
with the sun so dark and the hour so late

you can't overlook the lack, jack
of any other highway to ride
it's got no signs or dividing lines 
and very few rule to guide

i spent a little time on the mountain
i spent a little time on the hill
i saw things getting out of hand
i guess they always will

now i don't know, but i been told 
if the horse don't pull you, got to carry the load
i don't know whose back's that strong
maybe find out before too long

one way or another, one way or another
one way or another, this darkness got to give
one way or another, one way or another
one way or another, this darkness got to give
one way or another, one way or another
one way or another, this darkness got to give
