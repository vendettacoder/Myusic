at the dark end of the street
that's where we'll always meet
hiding in shadows where we don't belong
living in darkness to hide our wrong
you and me at the dark end of the street
you and me

i know that time's gonna take its toll
we'll have to pay for the love that we stole
'cause it's a sin and we know that we're wrong
oh, but our love keeps coming on strong
you and me at the dark end of the street
you and me

they're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
they're gonna find us someday
we'll steal away to the dark end of the street
you and me

if you take a walk downtown
and find some time to look around
if you should see me and i walk on by
oh, darling, please don't cry
tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
you and me

you and me
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
you and me (you and me)
(you and me)
(you and me)
