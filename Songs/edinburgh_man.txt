it's springtime but i still miss the streets at dawn
and in the morning walking your bridges home
as i sit and stare at all of england's souls
i tell you something
i wish i was in edinburgh

i don't mind being by myself
don't wanta be anywhere else
just wanna be in edinburgh
i wish i was an edinburgh man

you can leave me on the shelf
i'm an edinburgh man myself
i will always give you help

it's summertime but i still miss your skies so clear
sitting and staring on a beach somewhere
i'll tell you something
i wish i was in edinburgh

don't give a toss about private wealth
and history just repeats itself
keep me away from the festival
and just give me a warm quarter-gill*

they say you project yourself
but i'm an edinburgh man myself

it's wintertime and i still see the cobble stones
clacking over your streets at dawn
i was really poor since i left edinburgh

i'm ok just by myself
cause our miserable king won't protect us from ourselves
how i wish i was in edinburgh
how i wish i was in edinburgh

i was always in good health
i'm an edinburgh man myself
i will always give you help
i'm an edinburgh man myself
