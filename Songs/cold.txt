scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
take another face, you will be kissed again
i was cold as i mouthed the words, and crawled across the mirror
i wait, await the next breath
your name like ice into my heart

a shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
ice in my eyes, and eyes like ice don't move
screaming at the moon, another pastime
your name like ice into my heart

everything as cold as life, can no one save you?
everything, as cold as silence
and you never say a word
your name like ice into my heart
your name like ice into my heart
