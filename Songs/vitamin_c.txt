her daddy's got a big aeroplane
her mummy holds all the family cash
a beautiful rose is standing in the corner
she is living in and out of tune

hey you
you're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin c
hey you
you're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin c

monster press machine on her body
she is stepping on a quicksand
a beautiful rose is standing in the corner
she is living in and out of tune

hey you
you're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin c
hey you
you're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin c
