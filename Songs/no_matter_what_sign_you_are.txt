the moon shines bright above
but the charts declare
it's not my night for love
ah, deep in my heart
i feel a good vibrations saying
"you and me, babe, would make a good combination"

there's no need in looking to the skies
can't you see the stars shine in my eyes
i love you, boy, i really love you, boy

no matter what sign you are
you're gonna be mine you are
can't let astrology chart our destiny
no matter what sign you are
you're gonna be mine you are
the beat of the heart, my love
is stronger than the charts, my love

your water sign just lit my fire
you fill me with such desire
i love you, boy, i really love you, boy

no matter what sign you are
you're gonna be mine you are
can't let astrology chart our destiny
no matter what sign you are
you're gonna be mine you are
i need you beside me, love
only you can guide my love

capricorn, scorpio, taurus, gemini, virgo,
cancer, pisces, leo, libra, aries

i don't care about your rising sign
all i know is when your lips touch mine
you move me, boy, you really move me, boy

no matter what sign you are
you're gonna be mine you are
yes, you are
hold me, boy
no matter what sign you are
you're gonna be mine you are
