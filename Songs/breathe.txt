wish i could breathe
wish i could stand
wish i had a chance here holding your hand
wish i could speak
wish i could talk
wish i could breathe

since the first day i was alive
i feared we would meet here in the misty outside
wanted to run
wanted to hide
wish i could breathe

i feel a chill deep in my bones
nothing can heal the way my blood moans
nothing can quench
my bitter thirst
wish i could breathe

grasp at my heart that burns in my chest
it's your precious art that makes my soul stressed
run short of blood
light-headed i swoon
wish i could breathe

i fear we can't overcome
this place
i know
your face
your hands
wish i could breathe

wish i could breathe
wish i could stand
wish i had a chance here holding your hand
wish i could speak
wish i could talk
wish i could breathe

since the first day i was alive
i feared we would meet here in the misty outside
wanted to run
wanted to hide
wish i could breathe

i fear we can't overcome
this place
i know
your face
your hands
wish i could breathe

wish i could breathe
wish i could fall
wish i could think nothing at all 
wish i could talk
wish i could speak
wish i could breathe
