i had seven faces
thought i knew which one to wear
i'm sick of spending these lonely nights
training myself not to care

the subway is a porno
the pavements, they are a mess
i know you've supported me for a long time
somehow i'm not impressed

but new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)
new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)
new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)
new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)

subway, she is a porno
and the pavements they are a mess
i know you've supported me for a long time
somehow i'm not impressed

it's up to me now
turn on the bright lights
oh, it's up to me now
turn on the bright lights

new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)
new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)
new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)
new york cares
(got to be some more change in my life)

it's up to me now
(got to be some more change in my life)
turn on the bright lights
(got to be some more change in my life)
oh, it's up to me now
(got to be some more change in my life)
turn on the bright lights
(got to be some more change in my life)
