your 'fight them on the beaches' speeches make me despair 
'cause if there's one thing we can guarantee is you will not he there 
tidying your room, making up your bed 
and if your diary's full that week you'll send us lot instead 

send us lot instead, put a poppy by my lovers bed 
we believe you when you say you've hurt your back 

have you ever been away 
where were you when we took calais? 
you don 't know, you don't care 
you 're just glad that you wasn't there 
have you ever been away 

i'm afraid your rule britannia mania doesn't ring so true 
if i was captain of the waves i'd turn the gun on you 
any last requests before you join dead? 
i'll crap into your union jack and wrap it round your head 

wrap it round your head, take a look at all the blood we've shed 
we'll believe you when you say it was worth it 

liberate the streets of europe, give our kids a chance 
give them beaujolais by tap and cheap day trips to france 
but you have never seen or smelt this ungodly death 
it's like the stench of roasted lamb upon your father's breath
