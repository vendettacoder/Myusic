hey there, georgy girl
swingin' down the street so fancy-free
nobody you meet could ever see
the loneliness there
inside you

hey there, georgy girl
why do all the boys just pass you by?
could it be you just don't try
or is it the clothes you wear?

you're always window-shopping
but never stopping to buy
so, shed those dowdy feathers and fly
a little bit

hey there, georgy girl
there's another georgy deep inside
bring out all the love you hide
and, oh, what a change there'd be
the world would see
a new georgy girl

hey there, georgy girl
dreamin' of the someone you could be
life is a reality
you can't always run away

don't be so scared of changing
and rearranging yourself
it's time for jumping down from the shelf
a little bit

hey there, georgy girl
there's another georgy deep inside
bring out all the love you hide
and, oh, what a change there'd be
the world would see
a new georgy girl

(hey there, georgy girl)
wake up, georgy girl
(hey there, georgy girl)
come on, georgy girl
(hey there, georgy girl)
wake up, georgy girl
(hey there, georgy girl)
come on, georgy girl
