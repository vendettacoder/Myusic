in the morning your face cracks and falls to the sea
the sun follows your step end leads you back to me
you keep telling yourself that you're here but you're not alone
and you get the feeling that your mind is not your own

in the evening the sun's red  gown turns to brown
the moon follows you to the beach then it swallows you down
strange how you change and end up at her feet
you keep telling yourself but you know your not be believed

you and me and hercules in between
you and me and hercules in between

shadows rise from the plain...fifty men row
in the distance the ships in the waves cash in their load
on the hill stands colossus and your mind is freezed
clouds from your past now at last open to reveal

you and me and hercules in between
you and me and hercules in between

cross the desert sand no one knows your name
and you wish you were somewhere else with some kind of fame
what appears as your shadow is formless as a mist
you keep telling your friends you know.. it exists
one become two then before you... turns to three
words climb your tongue... like a ladder to speak
drifting as you go but you row..'til it seems
all is one. all is mind,all is lost and you find
all is dream

you and me hercules in between...
