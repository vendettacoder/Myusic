september girls do so much
i was your butch and you were touched
i loved you, well, nevermind
i've been crying all the time

december boys got it bad
december boys got it bad

september girls, i don't know why
how can i deny what's inside?
even though i'll keep away
they will love all our days

december boys got it bad
december boys got it bad

when i get to bed late at night
that's the time she makes things right
ooh, when she makes love to me

september girls do so much
i was your butch and you were touched
i loved you, well, nevermind
i've been crying all the time

december boys got it bad
december boys got it bad
december boys got it bad, ooh
