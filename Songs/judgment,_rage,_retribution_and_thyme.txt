when i look in the mirror
in front of me
any old mirror
that's in front of me
trouble, trouble
is all i see

the shadow i cast
is dark and long
beware of my shadow
it's dark and long

when i turn your corner
you best be gone
since the day of my birth
i've known i wasn't right
boo-hoo, i'm not right
got something awful living inside

oh look out

well at the end of my rope
and the end of my days
i'm at the end of my rope
and at the end of my days

gonna storm the pearly gates
and make them pay
