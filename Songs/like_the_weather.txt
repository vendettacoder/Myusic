the color of the sky as far as i can see
is coal grey
lift my head from the pillow and then
fall again

shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
quiver in my lip as if i might cry

well by the force of will my lungs are filled
and so i breathe
lately it seems this big bed is where
i never leave

shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
a quiver in my voice as i cry

what a cold and a rainy day
where on earth is the sun hid away

hear the sound of a noon bell chime
well, i'm far behind
you've put in 'bout half a day
while here i lie

with a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
a quiver in my voice as if i might cry

what a cold and a rainy day
where on earth is the sun hid away

do i need someone here to scold me
or do i need someone who'll grab and pull me out of
four-poster dull torpor pulling downward

for it's such a long time since my better days
i say my prayers nightly this will pass away

the color of the sky is grey as i can see
through the blinds
lift my head from the pillow and then
fall again

shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
a quiver in my voice as if i might cry

a cold and a rainy day
where on earth is the sun hid away
a cold and a rainy day
i shiver, quiver, and try to wake
