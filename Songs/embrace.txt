holding my head
for the last of race
pushing my body
to get that embrace

it won't last
hold on fast
it won't last
hold on fast

breathing in time
so hard to trace
crushing your skull
with my warming embrace

it won't last
hold on fast
it won't last
hold on fast

i fell down the stairs
i wished i were dead
you ran toward the light
he handed me your head
it won't last

it won't last
hold on fast
it won't last
hold on fast
