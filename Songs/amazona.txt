amazona
is a zone where
there is no doubt
no more fall-out -
why don't you step
through the mirror and see?
from arizona
to eldorado
sure is a mighty long way.
hey little girl
is something wrong?
i know it's hard
for you to get along
the bell-tower rings
it tolls a hollow sound
but your castles in spain
still may be realised
and longings more profound.
you see - every cloud
has a silver lining
and sometimes paradise
around your corner lies.
in amazona everything is nice
little one - come take my hand?
i'll try to help you there -
i'll take you there.
amazona's
getting closer
oh soon you'll see.
journey's over
we're almost there
