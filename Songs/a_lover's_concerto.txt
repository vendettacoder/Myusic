how gentle is the rain
that falls softly on the meadow?
birds, high up in the trees,
serenade the clouds with their melodies.

oh, see, there beyond the hill,
the bright colors of the rainbow.
some magic from above
made this day for us just to fall in love.

now, i belong to you
from this day until forever.
just love me tenderly
and i'll give to you every part of me.

oh, don't ever make me cry
through long, lonely nights without us.
be always true to me.
keep this day in your heart eternally.

someday we shall return
to this place upon the meadow.
we'll walk out in the rain,
hear the birds above singing once again.

you'll hold me in your arms 
and say once again you love me
and, if your love is true,
everything will be just as wonderful.

you'll hold me in your arms 
and say once again you love me
and, if your love is true,
everything will be just as wonderful.

you'll hold me in your arms 
and say once again you love me
and, if your love is true,
everything will be just as wonderful.
