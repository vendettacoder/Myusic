sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
lying by the river just like he usually done (oh no)
call for his whiskey, he can call for his tea
call all he want to but he can't call me (oh no)

oh no, well i've been there before
and not coming back around there no more

hung up waiting for a windy day
hung up waiting for a windy day

creepy alligator coming all around the bend
talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends
i'll check my memory and i check it again, yes i will
i checked it running some old kind of trick (oh no)

oh no! well i've been there before
and i ain't coming back around there no more, no i'm not

riding down the river in an old canoe
a bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
out of the river all ugly and green
the biggest old alligator that i've ever seen

teeth big and pointy and his eyes were bugging out
contracted the union, put the beggars to rout
screaming and yelling, he was picking his chops
he never runs he just stumbles and hops
just out of prison on six dollars bail
mumbling bitches and wagging his tail

alligator running 'round my door
alligator running 'round my door
alligator running 'round my door
alligator running 'round my door

alligator's creeping in and he's crawling around on my cabin floor
he's coming round to bother me some more
