hey,
now just get in
and close the door
and put your foot down

you know, i like this suburb we're going through
and i've been around here many times before
when i was young we were gonna move out this way
for the clean air, healthy, you know
away from the factories and the smoke
i like that shop, too
you can get anything there

so just get in
and we'll go for a ride

'cos we'll go driving away from home
thirty miles or more
and we'll go moving away from home
without a care

i'll tell you what
why don't we cross the city limit
and head on down the m62
it's only thirty nine miles
and forty five minutes to manchester
and that's my birth-place, you know

driving away from home
thirty miles or more
and we'll go moving away from home
without a care in the world

driving away from home
thirty miles or more
yes, we'll go moving away from home
without a care

some of my friends live up north, too
if you like a longer trip
all you've got to do is put your foot hard down to the floor
and we can call on people i know in newcastle
or maybe even glasgow

there's a lot of nice places to see out there
so just don't worry

moving away from home
without a care in the world

driving away from home
thirty miles or more
yes, we'll go moving away from home
without a care in the world

move-em on, move-em out, move-em up
king of the road, knight of the road
it's all the same to me
i mean, after all
it's just a road

driving away from home
drivin'...
driving away from home

drivin'...
driving away from home
drivin'...
