down, down, you bring me down
i hear you knocking down my door
and i can't sleep at night.
your face it has no place
no room for you inside my house
i need to be alone.

don't waste your words i don't need anything from you,
i don't care where you've been or what you plan to do.

turn, turn, i wish you'd learn
there's a time and place for everything
i've got to get it through.
cut loose 'cause you're no use
i couldn't stand another
second in your company.

don't waste your words i don't need anything from you,
i don't care where you've been or what you plan to do.

stone me why can't you see
you're a no one nowhere washed up baby
who'd look better dead.
your tongue is far too long
i don't like the way it sucks and
slurs upon my every word.

don't waste your words i don't need anything from you,
i don't care where you've been or what you plan to do.

i am the resurrection and i am the life,
i couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as i'd like.

i am the resurrection and i am the life,
i couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as i'd like.
