(lee, wagon)

you drive me ape
you big gorilla
you drive me ape,ape
i wanna tell ya

swinging around from every town to town
i swing around and i never come down
city is a jungle now this is it
every time i look at you i go ape shit

chorus

cruising through the trees
with the birds and the bees
baby,baby monkey,i ain't so hard to please
cruising through the trees
with the birds and the bees
baby,baby monkey,you won't get no disease

lead

chorus
