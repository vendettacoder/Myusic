hey, i'm on my way
on a journey outta this world
hey, i'm on my way
on a journey outta this world
swirling through the vortex 
to the center of a girl 

i gotta rocket '88
prone to 69
spinnin' around and down 
leavin' everything behind
let go of the controls 
and slip outside my mind 

space begins to curve
light begins to twist
across a thigh of satin 
and through a veil of mist
there's a girl's netherworld
lookin' for a kiss so

hey, i'm on my way
on a journey outta this world
hey, i'm on my way
on a journey outta this world
swirling through the vortex 
to the center of a girl 

glidin' through this friction 
like some science-fiction thrill
getting off in these dimensions
where time itself stands still
flowin' through a whirlpool 
to a she-feast wrapped in silk

hey, i'm on my way
on a journey outta this world
hey, i'm on my way
on a journey outta this world
swirling through the vortex 
to the center of a girl 

hey, i'm on my way
hey, i'm on my way
hey, i'm on my way
hey, i'm on my way
hey, i'm on my way
hey, i'm on my way...
