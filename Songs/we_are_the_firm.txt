backstreet boys are here to stay 
nothin' will get in their way 
we're the firm and they all know, 
when we come they don't wanna know, 
we're the ones who still win the day 
running rouning that's our way 
we all like it everyday 
we don't worry about it 
we don't care we're used to it, 
so don't give us no verbal on our way!

we're the firm! we're the firm!
we're the firm! we're the firm!

people try to shut us up 
we don't care we ain't no pufs 
we don't worry about it 
we don't care we're used to it, 
so don't give us no verbal for today!
