i found the perfect picture of a perfect stranger
it looked as if it were taken in the forties sometime
judging by the style

he could be a killer or a blind man with a cane
perhaps he died in a car crash years ago
right now, it's impossible to tell

i almost thought i saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge
i asked him the time, but when he turned around
i saw it wasn't him at all

i'm still searching
i'm still searching

i saw him in an airport while he was sitting on a wing
and i waved to him, but i don't think he noticed me
i've got a funny feeling i know who he is
