you thought i wouldn't sell without you sold 9 million

you thought i couldn't see without you perfect vision
you thought i couldn't last without you but i'm lastin'
you thought that i would die without you but i'm livin'
thought that i would fail without you but i'm on top
thought it would be over by now but it won't stop
thought that i would self-destruct but i'm still here
even in my years to come i'm still gon' be here
