professionally trendy in the glow of clapham sun
there's life after work and it can be such fun
you see all your models in magazines and on the walls
you wanna be just like them cause they're so cool

they're just narcissists
well, wouldn't it be nice to be dorian gray
just for a day?
they're just narcissists
oh, what's so great to be dorian gray
every day?

we're living in a looking glass
as the beauty of life goes by
you're going to be so old
you're going to grow so old
your skin so cold

well, they're just narcissists
well, wouldn't it be nice to be dorian gray
just for a day?
such narcissists
what's so great to be dorian gray
every day?

they're just narcissists
wouldn't it be great to be dorian gray
just for a day?
just for a day?
