well, we live in a trailer at the edge of town
you never see us 'cause we don't come around.
we got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down.
but we need you now, and that's why i'm hangin' 'round.
so you be good to me and i'll be good to you,
and in this land of conditions i'm not above suspicion
i won't attack you, but i won't back you.

well, it's so good to be here, asleep on your lawn.
remember your guard dog? well, i'm afraid that he's gone.
it was such a drag to hear him whining all night long.
yes, that was me with the doves, setting them free near the factory
where you built your computer, love.
i hope you get the connection, 'cause i can't take the rejection
i won't deceive you, i just don't believe you.

well, i'm a barrel of laughs, with my carbine on
i keep 'em hoppin', till my ammunition's gone.
but i'm still not happy, i feel like there's something wrong.
i got the revolution blues, i see bloody fountains,
and ten million dune buggies comin' down the mountains.
well, i hear that laurel canyon is full of famous stars,
but i hate them worse than lepers and i'll kill them in their cars.
