tallulah took a shower for an hour,
then walked down the street feeling beautiful and clean.
taulah met a man at a newstand,
who asked her how does she dream.
what she's missing
is someone
who will listen
and then and then and then, you tell me.

tallulah your make-up needs a shake-up,
your hair frames a perfect face.
tallulah wasn't liberated,
by france or any other revolution.
what she's missing
is someone
who will listen
and then and then and then, you tell me.

you tell me, i have a choice. you. you. you. come on.
