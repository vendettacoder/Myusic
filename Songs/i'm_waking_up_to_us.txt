i need someone to take some joy in something i do
you need a man who's either rich or losing a screw
you know i love you here's the irony
you're going to walk away intact
i think you never liked me anyway
you like yourself and you like
men to kiss your arse
expensive clothes
please stop me there
i think i'm waking up to us
we're a disaster
you don't want to know me
'cause you move in circles of the brave
where art defines their lives

she was the one love of my life, and i let her go
and if i look like death today,
then please let her know
i never wanted to do harm to her
i only wanted her to see
the beauty of the world surrounding her
but when she opened up her eyes
it's much too late
our chance has gone
she's with a guy
who takes the prize for everything i ever showed her
digging all the fun
because she's older
i fed her with a spoon
i made her mother smile
i helped the kid survive

she was the one love of my life,
she showed me the road
i loved her dog, her steady gaze, the chapter is closed
i always wanted all the best for her
the best thing was to stay away
she grew up and she left the rest of us
and now the understanding's gone
i haven't changed, how could i?
i'm pretty much the same person
i cannot keep the anger hidden anymore
but lucky for you, you are not around
my anger turns to pity and to love
the season has arrived
