in ancient times
hundreds of years 
before the dawn of history
there lived a strange race of people - the druids.

no one knows who they were, 
or what they were doing.
but their legacy remains 
hewn into the living rock of stonehenge.

stonehenge - where the demons dwell
where the banshees live 
and they do live well
stonehenge - where a man is a man 
and the children dance 
to the pipes of pan

stonehenge - 'tis a magic place 
where the moon doth rise
with a dragon's face
stonehenge - where the virgins lie
and the prayer of devils 
fills the midnight sky

and you my love, 
won't you take my hand
we'll go back in time 
to that mystic land
where the dew drops cry 
and the cats meow
i will take you there
i will show you how

and oh, how they danced
the little children of stonehenge 
beneath the haunted moon 
for fear that daybreak might come too soon 

and where are they now, the little people of stonehenge?
and what would they say to us if they were here tonight?
