she smelled like flowers, she taste like toffee
she kissed me slowly, she held me soflty
got too close and she backed up off me
left me stone cold sober just like black coffee
just like black coffee

she told me that she'd always be thinkin of me
she said she wanted me to know that she really did love me
she said she'd never put no one else above me
except her monkey, she's like a junky
just like a junky
just like a junky

its april 25th its up around 80
found a spot out in the park where the grass was shady
she said her mom's from jamaica, said her father's from haiti
such a pretty lady, she's such a lady

she smelled like flowers, she taste like toffee
she kissed me slowly, she held me softly
got to close and she backed up off me
she left me stone cold sober just like black coffee
just like black coffee (x3)
