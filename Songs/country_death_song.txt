i had me a wife, i had me some daughters
i tried so hard; i never knew still waters
nothing to eat and nothing to drink
nothing for a man to do but sit around and think
nothing for a man to do but sit around and think

well, i'm a-thinkin' and thinkin', 'til there's nothin' i ain't thunk
breathing in the stink 'til finally i stunk
it was at that time, i swear i lost my mind
i started making plans to kill my own kind
i started making plans to kill my own kind

"come, little daughter," i said to the youngest one
"put your coat on, we'll have some fun
we'll go out to mountains, the one to explore."
her face then lit up, i was standing by the door
her face then lit up, i was standing by the door

"come, little daughter, i will carry the lanterns
we'll go out tonight, we'll go to the caverns
we'll go out tonight, we'll go to the caves
kiss your mother goodnight and remember that god saves
kiss your mother goodnight and remember that god saves."

i led her to a hole, a deep black well
i said, "make a wish, make sure and not tell
and close your eyes, dear, and count to seven
you know your papa loves you; good children go to heaven
you know your papa loves you; good children go to heaven."

i gave her a push, i gave her a shove
i pushed with all my might, i pushed with all my love
i threw my child into a bottomless pit
she was screaming as she fell, but i never heard her hit
she was screaming as she fell, but i never heard her hit

gather round, boys, to this tale that i tell
you wanna know how to take a short trip to hell?
it's guaranteed to get your own place in hell
just take your lovely daughter and push her in the well
take your lovely daughter and throw her in the well

don't speak to me of lovers with a broken heart
you wanna know what can really tear you apart?
i'm going out to the barn; will i never stop in pain?
i'm going out to the barn to hang myself in shame
