we were together since we were five
she was so pretty
emma was a star in everyone's eyes
and when she said she'd be a movie queen
nobody laughed
her face like an angel, she could be anything

emmalene
emma, emmalene
i'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
emmalene
emma, emmalene
i'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen

at seventeen we were wed
and worked day and night to earn our daily bread
and every day emma would go out searching for that play
that never ever came her way

you know sometimes she'd come home so depressed
i'd hear her crying in the back room feeling so distressed
and i'd remember back when she was five
to the words that used to make emmalene come alive

it was emmalene
emma, emmalene
i'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
emmalene
emma, emmalene
i'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen

it was cold and dark december night
when i opened the bedroom door
to find her lying still and cold up on the bed
a love letter lying on the bedroom floor

it read, "darling, i love you.
but i just can't keep on living on dreams no more.
i tried so very hard not to leave you alone.
i just can't keep on tryin' no more."

emmalene 
oh, emmalene
emmalene
