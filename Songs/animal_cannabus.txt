don't find me, don't feel safe 
don't suffer or crumble 
don't listen to what they've got to say 

don't find me, don't feed me 
don't bail out or preach to me 
just listen to what i've got to say 

don't leave me caged up 
i'll face it in my own little ways 
in my own simple ways 
don't forget my make-up 
or i'll wait by your house 
there's one way out only one way out 

and leave the animal home 
set up on you own 
and find the way out 
the animal cannabus left you here 
to move with the same old forces 
the same old forces 

don't corner me, don't sit on me 
don't make up excuses 
but don't bury me from what they've got to say 

and one by one the doubts return to me 
and one by one the doubts return to me 
yeah and i've retired to a better life 
hiding from the world 
hiding from the world 
yeah and i've retired to a better life 
it gets under my skin 

and leave the animal home 
set up on you own 
and find the way out 
the animal cannabus left you here 
to move with the same old forces 
the same old forces 

the posters show you the clothes 
that you've got to wear 
the roadside signs can lead you there 
and fashion is the fast food 
you can eat all you can 
in the hamburger hell  
in the hamburger hell 

don't find me 
don't feel safe 

don't suffer or crumble 
just listen to what they've got to say
