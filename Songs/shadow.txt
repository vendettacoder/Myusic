oh why is your hate so addicting and i
well i wonder where you've been
i don't see you often

i try to feel something for you
but that's all that i can do
give my shadow to you

do you ever see me at night 
and does it please you at all 
when you head up the wall

i'd go with you if you asked me to
but we wouldn't get too far
two strangers in the dark
