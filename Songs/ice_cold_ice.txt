barren lands and barren minds
in another place and time
i feel i've never known myself
frozen in the sand again

see the blank expressions waiting for progression
they're standing still in place and time
and no one's moving, they're only
standing still in ice cold ice cold ice

all machines and all are one
catching up on what's been done
stealing glimpses from the past
these impressions always last

never penetrating, always contemplating
we sit and count the blessings but we're blessed by icons
no one else could
trust in ice cold ice cold ice

we'll stay together till the end
thinking you might be a friend

we sit and pray together that they might change the weather
my love for you will never die
if i sound distant, that's because
you shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
