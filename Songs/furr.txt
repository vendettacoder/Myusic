yeah, when i was only seventeen
i could hear the angels whispering
so i drove into the woods
and wandered aimlessly about 
until i heard my mother shouting through the fog
it turned out to be the howling of a dog
or a wolf, to be exact
the sound sent shivers down my back
but i was drawn into the pack and before long
they allowed me to join in and sing their song
so from the cliffs and highest hills
yeah, we would gladly get our fill
howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
and i lost the taste for judging right from wrong
for my flesh had turned to fur
yeah, and my thoughts they surely were
turned to instinct and obedience to god

you can wear your fur
like a river on fire
but you'd better be sure
if you're making god a liar
i'm a rattlesnake, babe,
i'm like fuel on a fire
so if you're gonna get made
don't be afraid of what you've learned

on the day that i turned 23
i was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
when suddenly a girl
her skin the color of a pearl
she wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see
she was listening for the angels just like me
so i stood and looked about
i brushed the leaves off of my snout
and then i heard my mother shouting through the trees
you should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
so i took her by the arm
we settled down upon a farm
and raised our children up as gently as you please

and now my fur has turned to skin
and i've been quickly ushered in
to a world that, i confess, i do not know
but i still dream of running careless through the snow
and through the howling winds that blow
across the ancient distant flow
to fill our bodies up like water till we know

you can wear your fur
like a river on fire
but you'd better be sure
if you're making god a liar
i'm a rattlesnake, babe,
i'm like fuel on a fire
so if you're gonna get made
don't be afraid of what you've learned
