when the room is quiet
the daylight almost gone
it seems there's something i should know
well i ought to leave but
the rain it never stops
and i have no particular place to go

just when i think i'm winning
when i've broken every door
the ghosts of my life
blow wilder than before
just when i thought i could not be stopped
when my chance came to be king
the ghosts of my life
blew wilder than the wind

well i'm feeling nervous
and i find myself alone
the simple life's no longer there
once i was so sure
now the doubt inside my mind
comes and goes but leads nowhere

just when i think i'm winning
when i've broken every door
the ghosts of my life
blow wilder than before
just when i thought i could not be stopped
when my chance came to be king
the ghosts of my life
blew wilder than the wind
