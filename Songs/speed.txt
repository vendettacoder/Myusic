take me with you
my soul is on

get back with your heart attack

can i ride your motorbike?
karaoke nights by the sea
bomber jacket hyperspace
leather laced in 3d
water's crashing
road keeps turning on

so hold on, hold on
take me with you
my soul is on

can i stay with you?
make it easy for me
you are the most selfish kind
nevermind what i need
water's crashing
road keeps turning on and on and on

so hold on, hold on
take me with you
my soul is on
hold on, hold on

sliup - ummm - crack
goes the backscreen door
she wanted to go for coffee
but i sleep an hour more
see mary dancing across the porch
she put her rolled up ziggys in her rock and roll jersey
jersey, she was born to run
she was the spirit of midnight
she was blinded by the light
she was holed up in jungleland
straight up
the rock and roll big boss
turnpike down by the river of desire
just off thunder road
where you catch her in the tenth avenue
freeze out
she was lost in a flood
mary, queen of arkansas
dreaming of a cadillac ranch with a hungry heart
but most of all she was born in the usa
ashbury park, new jersey
inner state babe
to be exact she was her own rock and roll video
rolls royce, low riding
speed climbing, driving by the sea
making mad love on other people's private property
while being on the run from the local law for unpaid parking tickets

can i stay with you?
make it easy for me

are you a tramp like that?
are you born to run?
if you's a tramp like that
c'mon, give me some
you like your guitars fat
you like your beach with bum
i never had no fun
c'mon, let me ride shotgun
'cause i'm a tramp like that
yeah, i'm a tramp like that
and i'm gonna give you so much
new jersey girl
we gonna ride around
new jersey girl
new jersey girl, new jersey sun

bring it on
hear me scream

how y'all feel out there?
i can't hold it back
