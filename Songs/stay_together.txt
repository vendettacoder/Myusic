stay together lyrics

come to my house tonight,
we can be together in the nuclear sky,
and we will dance in the poison rain, 
and we can stay a while in heaven today.

(chorus)

stay together
let's stay, these days are ours.

stay together
two hearts under the skyscrapers.

there's a time bomb in the high rise
there's a blue suburban dream.
will i see you up in paradise?
or have you come to touch me?

come to my arms tonight,
you and me together under electric light.
she will dance in the poisoned air,
just you and me forever by the motorway there.

(chorus)

come to my arms i'm lost,
just you and me together in the year of the horse.
single file in the nuclear night,
and we can feel a little closer as we tumble through the sky.

(chorus)

(repeat chorus)
