here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
birds of passage, you and me
we fly instinctively
when the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
neither you nor i'm to blame when all is said and done

in our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
we're still striving for the sky
no taste for humble pie
thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
neither you nor i'm to blame when all is said and done

it's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
how you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
clear-headed and open-eyed
with nothing left untried
standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run
there's no hurry any more when all is said and done

standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
there's no hurry any more when all is said and done
