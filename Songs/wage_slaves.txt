c'mon!

scathing attacks of time and torment
when we sleep walk our lives away
these thieves
they've made our hearts break

so now i'm screaming
attacks of heartless horror
at them their cash can't kill us all
and now we have built we have
we have built upon their dream too long (for too long)
don't be their fucking slaves

we live in exploitation we have worked blind
endless means
they have turned our failure into what they need
so break these shackles and take a stand
we are the gears
we are the ones they fear
take their crowns away

they won't take away my life, a slave no longer
in my mind i break these shackles
and take a stand to tell the world
the revolt returns

break these shackles
and take a stand to tell the world
get up

we live in exploitation we have worked blind
endless means
they have turned our failure into what they need
take it back
take it back
take it all back (take it, take it all back)
