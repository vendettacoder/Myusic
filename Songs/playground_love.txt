i'm a high school lover, 
and you're my favorite flavor.
love is all, all my soul.
you're my playground love.

yet my hands are shaking.
i feel my body reeling, 
times no matter, i'm on fire.
on the playground, love.

you're the piece of gold 
that flashes on my soul.
extra time, on the ground.
you're my playground love.

anytime, anywhere,
you're my playground love.
