your time has come 
your second skin 
the cost so high 
the gain so low 
walk through the valley 
the written word is a lie 

may the road rise with you 
may the road rise with you 
may the road rise with you 

i could be wrong

they put a hot wire to my head 
'cause of the things i did and said 
they made these feelings go away 
model citizen in every way 

may the road rise with you 
may the road rise with you 
may the road rise with you 

anger is an energy 
anger is an energy 
anger is an energy 

may the road rise with you

anger is an energy 
anger is an energy
