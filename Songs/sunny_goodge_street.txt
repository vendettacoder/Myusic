on the firefly platform on sunny goodge street
violent hash-smoker shook a chocolate machine
involved in an eating scene.
smashing into neon streets in their stillness
smearing their eyes on the crazy kali goddess
listenin' to sounds of mingus mellow fantastic.
my, my, they sigh
my, my, they sigh
in dull house rooms with coloured lights swingin'
strange music boxes sadly tinklin'
drink in the sun shining all around you.
my, my, they sigh
my, my, they sigh
the magician, he sparkles in satin and velvet,
you gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet.
i tell you his name is love, love, love.
my, my, they sigh
my, my, they sigh
my, my, they sigh
