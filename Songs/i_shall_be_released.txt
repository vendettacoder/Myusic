they say everything can be replaced
they say every distance is not near
so i remember every face
of every man who put me here

i see my light come shinin'
from the west down to the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released

they say every man needs protection
they say that every man must fall
yet i swear i see my reflection
somewhere so high above this wall 

i see my light come shinin'
from the west down to the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released

now, yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
a man who swears he's not to blame
all day long, i hear him shouting so loud
just crying out that he was framed

i see my light come shinin'
from the west down to the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released
