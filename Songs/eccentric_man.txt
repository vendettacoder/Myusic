my chest is a 36
my overcoat is full of poison
my trousers end six inches from the ground
three inches from my shoes
tied up with a piece of string and
held together with free spoon glue

call me an eccentric man
i don't believe i am
call me an eccentric man
i don't believe i am

my bed is a park bench 
and my sheet and blankets are newspaper pages
the people think i'm crazy
but i know i'm wiser than all the sages,
'cos i have money they think that i'm a fool for doing what i do, but i know it's right

call me an eccentric man
i don't believe i am
call me an eccentric man
i don't believe i am

if ever i want to
i could have the comfort of my country home
but until that time
i'm quite content to have
walls made of bridge stones
a carpet of moss, a ceiling of sky
and a brown rat for a watch dog

call me an eccentric man
i don't believe i am
call me an eccentric man
i don't believe i am
