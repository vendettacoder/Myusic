my love must be a kind of blind love
i can't see anyone but you
sha bop sha bop

are the stars out tonight?
i don't know if it's cloudy or bright
i only have eyes for you, dear

the moon may be high
but i can't see a thing in the sky
i only have eyes for you

i don't know if we're in a garden
or on a crowded avenue

you are here and so am i
maybe millions of people go by
but they all disappear from view
and i only have eyes for you
