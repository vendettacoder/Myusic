(winter coming
winter for sure, for sure
oh, winter for sure
winter - the snow, winter moves on)

the last night on maudlin street
goodbye house - goodbye stairs
i was born here, i was raised here and
i took some stick here
love at first sight may sound trite
but it's true, you know
i could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
as we spend the last night on maudlin street
"goodbye house, forever!"
i never stole a happy hour around here
where the world's ugliest boy
he became what you see
here i am - the ugliest man
oh the last night on maudlin street
truly i do love you
oh, truly i do love you
when i sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but i think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, i told you it was silly...)
and i know i took strange pills
but i never meant to hurt you
oh, truly i love you
came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
but you know, no one stays up for you
i had sixteen stitches all around my head
the last bus i missed to maudlin street
so, he drove me home in the van
complaining: "women only like me for my mind.."
don't leave your torch behind, a power-cut ahead 1972, you know
and so we crept through the park
no, i cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline for you
but you without clothes
oh i could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well, a nation turns its back and gags..
and i'm packed
i am moving house
a half-life disappears today
with every hag waves me on
secretly wishing me gone
well, i will be soon
oh - i will be soon, i will be soon..
there were bad times on maudlin street
they took you away in a police car
dear inspector - don't you know?
don't you care? don't you know about love?
your gran died and your mother died
on maudlin street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
i took the keys from maudlin street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
oh.. truly i love you
wherever you are
wherever you are
wherever you are
i hope you're singing now
oh i do, i hope you're singing now
