well, it happened years ago
when you lived on stanhope road
we listened to your sister
when she came home from school
'cause she was two years older
and she had boys in her room
we listened outside and heard her
alright
well, that was alright for a while
but soon, i wanted more
i want to see as well as hear
and so i hid inside her wardrobe
and she came home 'round four
and she was with some kid called david
from the garage up the road
i listened outside, i heard her
alright

oh, i want to take you home
i want to give you children
and you might be my girlfriend, yeah

when i saw you next day
i really couldn't tell you
'cause you might go and tell your mother
and so you went with neve
and neve was coming on
and i thought i heard you laughing
when his mum and dad were gone
i listened outside, i heard you
alright

oh, i want to take you home
i want to give you children
you might be my girlfriend, yeah

well, i guess it couldn't last too long
i came home one day
and all her things were gone
i fell asleep inside
i never heard her come
and then she opened up her wardrobe
and i had to get it on
oh, listen we were on the bed
when you came home
i heard you stop 
outside the door
i know you won't
believe it's true
i only went with her
'cause she looks like you
alright

oh, i want to take you home
i want to give you children
you might be my girlfriend, yeah
