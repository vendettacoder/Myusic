round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
every day i make my way
through the streets of your town

and don't the sun look good today? (shine)
but the rain is on its way (shine)
watch the butcher shine his knives (shine)
and this town is full of battered wives

round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
every day i make my way
through the streets of your town

and i ride your river under the bridge (shine)
and i take your boat out to the reach (shine)
'cause i love that engine roar (shine)
but i still don't know what i'm here for

round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
every day i make my way
through the streets of your town

they shut it down
they closed it down
they shut it down
they pulled it down

round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
every day i make my way
through the streets of your town

round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
every day i make my way
through the streets of your town

round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
every day i make my way
through the streets of your town

round and round, up and down
through the streets of your town
