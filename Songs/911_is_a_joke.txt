hit me
going, going, gone

now i dialed 9-1-1 a long time ago
don't you see how late they're reactin'?
they only come and they come when they wanna
so get the morgue enbalm the goner
they don't care cuz they stay paid anyway
they teach ya like an ace they ain't be betrayed
a no-use number with no-use people
if your life is on the line, then you're dead today
late comings with the late comin' stretcher
that's a body bag in disguise y'all, i betcha
i call 'em body snatchers 'cuz they come to fetch ya
with an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
they are the kings cuz they swing amputation
lose your arms, your legs to them it's compilation
i can prove it to you watch the rotation
it all adds up to a funky situation

chorus:
so get up-a get get get down
9-1-1 is a joke in yo' town
get up-a get get get down
late 9-1-1 wears the late crown

9-1-1 is a joke (x2)

everyday they don't never come correct
you can ask my man right here with the broken neck
he's a witness to the job never being done
he would've been in full 8 9-1-1
was a joke cuz they' always jokin'
they the token to your life when it's croakin'
they need to be in a pawn shop on a 
9-1-1 is a joke we don't want 'em
i call a cab cuz a cab will come quicker
the doctors huddle up and call a flea ficker
the reason that i say that cuz they
flick you off like fleas
they be laughin' at ya while you're crawlin' on your knees
and to the strength so go the length
thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
you better wake up and smell the real flavor
cuz 9-1-1 is a fake life saver

chourus

ow, ow, 9-1-1 is a joke
