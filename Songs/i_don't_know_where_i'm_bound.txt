i don't know where i'm bound, i don't know where i'm bound,
whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and i don't know where i'm bound.

can't stand bars, locks, or doors,
mean cops, insanity, and wars;
gotta find a place of peace,
until then, my traveling won't cease,
but i don't know where i'm bound.

there's gotta be a place for me,
under some green growing tree;
clear cool water running by,
an unfettered view of the sky,
but i don't know where i'm bound.

when i die, don't bury me,
cause then i must be free;
cremate my body with a grin,
throw my ashes to the wind,
cause i don't know where i'm bound.

i don't know where i'm bound, i don't know where i'm bound,
whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and i don't know where i'm bound.

got myself a little gal,
she has been a downright pal;
that old highway's calling me,
and free i gotta be,
but i don't know where i'm bound, i don't know where i'm bound.
i don't know where i'm bound.
