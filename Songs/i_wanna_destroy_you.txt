i wanna destroy you,
i wanna destroy you,
i wanna destroy you,
i wanna destroy you.

i feel it comin' on again, just like it did before,
they feed your pride with bordeom and they lead you on to war!
the way you treat each other really makes me feel ill,
'cos if you wanna fight then you're just dying to get killed!

i wanna destroy you,
i wanna destroy you.

a pox upon the media and everything you read,
they tell you your opinions and they're very good indeed!

i wanna destroy you.

and when i have destroyed you, i'll come picking at your bone,
and you won't have a single atom left to call your own!

i wanna destroy you,
i wanna destroy you,
wanna destroy you,
wanna destroy you,
wanna destroy you.
