down in the park with the machmen
meet the machines playing kill by numbers
down in the park with a friend called five
i was in a car crash or was it the war?
but i've never been quite the same
little white lies like i was there

come to zom-zom's the place to eat
like it was built in one day
you can watch the humans trying to run
oh look, there's a rape machine
i'd go outside if it'd look the other way
wouldn't believe the things they do

down in the park
where the chant is death, death, death
'til sun cries morning
down in the park with friends of mine
we are not lovers, we are not romantics
we are here to serve you
different face but the words never change
