they don't eat, don't sleep, they don't feed, they don't seethe.
bare their gums when they moan and squeak.
lick the dirt off a larger one's feet.
they don't push, don't crowd.
congregate until they're much too loud.
fuck to procreate till they are dead.
drink the blood of their so-called best friend.

they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way.
don't pack themselves together and run as one.
don't shit where they're not supposed to.
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare.

they don't scam, don't fight.
don't oppress an equals given rights.
starve the poor so they can be well-fed.
line their holes with the dead one's bread.

they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way.
don't pack themselves together and run as one.
don't shit where they're not supposed to.
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare.

they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way.
don't pack themselves together and run as one.
don't shit where they're not supposed to.
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare.

rats... they don't compare.
rats... they don't compare.
