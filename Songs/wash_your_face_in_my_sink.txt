you wash your face in my sink 
in my sink 
you wash your face in my sink 
in my sink (sink) 
you wash your face in my sink 
in my sink (sink) 
you wash your face in my sink 

simplicity with synchronicity make a mind meld 
revealed if possible like a walk in a mind field 
sadly, you get up to bat and take a swing thing 
should i 
shouldn't i try? 
too late 
you sunk into the sink that i wash my face 

you wash your face in my sink 
in my sink 

tougher 
that's what i'm getting 
i'm getting rougher 
and you beat me? 
suffer 
the attempt of an attempt well tried 
well your side tried 
but my side will never be denied 
cause i'm swinging it stinging neglection 
with an injection of truth 
i've come to untwist the twisted youth 
how does it feel now that i've got you all to think? 
yeah, and wash your face in my sink 

you wash your face in my sink 

here i go i here i go i here i go again 
i have a little place to send a little false friend 
who tried to mess me up with little negative thoughts 
a little negative taught 
me to never ever leave my fame into the hands of incompetence 
that makes sense 
so now i change the tune for the tune allows changes 
for you to take a breath while your brain rearranges 
what i just spoke into a language called speech 
you try to catch it but you just can't reach 
for you leave a ring around the basin 
when you wash your face in 
in my sink 

you wash your face in my sink 

now the basin is clean to the gleam of the eye 
you constantly lie "when dove's cry" 
out that you are not about what you say 
the image of the field you reveal and portray 
for never ever will i fall fall to the effects of bandwagonism 
so please listen 
up not down 
for down is the devil 
so roll like a boulder and not like a pebble 
you roll like a rock, you roll like a rebel 
for this is pure pain 
pick ax and a shovel 
hear no command 
hear just warning 
if you wake up in the morning 
and wash your face in my sink 

you wash your face in my sink 

swing on the grounds of the play ground 
the wire to the amp to improve the sound 
i mean give me an m-i-c that is clean 
and witness the warriors of the dream 
for the bigger the orange 
is the bigger the peel 
thieves who steal 
get a wheel for real 
a spin to infin or until i give a pardon 
me, i never promised you a rose garden 
or nourishment just punishment for a fink 
who thinks he can wash his face in our sink 

you wash your face in my sink 

open up the door 
step across the wet floor 
you can make it 
you can tape it 
this rhyme forevermore 
peer into the drain as the water goes down 
why do you frown is the end of the sound 

but bring back the rhyme 
for the rhyme is evaporated 
and all of the sucker mcs 
to the jones is saying 
they would 
they could 
they think 
but never ever never dare try 
to wash their face in my sin
