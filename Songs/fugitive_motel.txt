lost in a lullaby 
side of the road
melt in a memory
slide in a solitude
not till i can read by the moon
am i going anywhere
not till i can read by the moon

i blow you a kiss
it should reach you tomorrow
as it flies from the other side of the world
from my room in my fugitive motel
somewhere in the dust bowl
it flies from the other side of the world

"i'm tired," i said.
"you always look tired," she said.
"i'm admired," i said.
"you always look tired," she said.
not till i can read by the moon
am i going anywhere
not till i can read by the moon

i blow you a kiss
it should reach you tomorrow, reach you tomorrow
it flies from the other side of the world
from my room in my fugitive motel
somewhere in the dust bowl, somewhere in the dust bowl
it flies from the other side of the world

curtains stay closed
but everyone knows
you hear through the walls in this place
cigarette holes for every lost soul
to give up the ghost in this place
give me strength
give me wings

i blow you a kiss
it should reach you tomorrow, reach you tomorrow
it flies from the other side of the world
from my room in my fugitive motel
somewhere in the dust bowl, somewhere in the dust bowl
it flies from the other side of the world
