you move it to the left, yeah
then you go for yourself
you move it to the right, yeah
if it takes all night

now take it kinda slow
with a whole lot of soul
don't move it too fast
and make it last

you know you scratch just like a monkey, yeah, you do
real, yeah
you slide into the limbo, yeah
how low can you go?

but come on, baby
i don't want you to scuffle now
you just groove it right here
to the harlem shuffle

yeah, yeah, yeah
do the harlem shuffle (oh, do the monkey shine)
yeah, yeah, yeah
do the harlem shuffle

hitch, hitch-hike baby
across the floor
whoa, whoa, whoa
i can't stand it no more

now come on, baby
now get into your slide
we're gonna ride, ride, ride
little pony ride

yeah

shake, shake, shake
shake a tail feather, baby, oooh!
shake, shake, shake
shake a tail feather, baby, oooh!

shake, shake, shake
shake a tail feather, baby, oooh!
