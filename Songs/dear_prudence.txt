dear prudence, won't you come out to play
dear prudence, greet the brand new day
the sun is up, the sky is blue
it's beautiful, and so are you
dear prudence, won't you come out and play

dear prudence, open up your eyes
dear prudence, see the sunny skies
the wind is low, the birds will sing
that you are part of everything
dear prudence, won't you open up your eyes?

look around 
look around 
look around
look around

dear prudence, let me see you smile
dear prudence, like a little child
the clouds will be a daisy chain
so let me see you smile again
dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile?

dear prudence, won't you come out to play
dear prudence, greet the brand new day
the sun is up, the sky is blue
it's beautiful, and so are you
dear prudence, won't you come out to play

look around round round round round
look around round round round round
look around round round round round
oh, look around, look around

look around round round round round
look around round round round round
look around around
oh, look around around

look around round round round round
look around round round round round
