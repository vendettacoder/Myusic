in the town where i was born
lived a man who sailed to sea
and he told us of his life
in the land of submarines
so we sailed on to the sun
till we found a sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine

we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, yellow submarine

and our friends are all aboard
many more of them live next door
and the band begins to play

we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, yellow submarine

full steam ahead, mr. boatswain, full steam ahead
full steam ahead it is, sergeant
cut the cable! drop the cable!
aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
captain, captain

as we live a life of ease
every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
in our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!)

we all live in a yellow submarine
a yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
a yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
