i have a trainset and a garage full of cars
and a soldier with a gun
my mother says i should have more responsibility
as i'm nearly 31

i have a plane, i have a crane
that can lift up all my trains and all my cars
i have a boat that doesn't float
but a big machine that takes me to the stars

but my mother says i should get a job
or my father she will tell
she says 16 years is a long enough rest
though i say that i'm not well

i have a trainset and a garage full of cars
and a soldier with a gun
my mother says she'll break up all my toys and all my games
and she'll say i'm not her son

but your mother says you should get a job
or your father she will tell
she says 16 years is a long enough rest
though you say that you're not well

i had a plane, i had a crane
that could lift up all my trains and all my cars
i had a boat that couldn't float
so my machine and me are going to the stars
