i used to wake up in the morning
i used to feel so bad
i got so sick of having sleepless nights
i went and told my dad

he said, "son now here's some little something"
and stuck them on my wall
and now my nights ain't quite so lonely
in fact i, i don't feel bad at all

pictures of lily made my life so wonderful
pictures of lily helped me sleep at night
pictures of lily solved my childhood problems
pictures of lily helped me feel alright

pictures of lily
lily, oh lily
lily, oh lily
pictures of lily

and then one day things weren't quite so fine
i fell in love with lily
i asked my dad where lily i could find
he said, "son, now don't be silly"

"she's been dead since 1929"
oh, how i cried that night
if only i'd been born in lily's time
it would have been alright

pictures of lily made my life so wonderful
pictures of lily helped me sleep at night

for me and lily are together in my dreams
and i ask you, "hey mister, have you ever seen"
"pictures of lily?"
