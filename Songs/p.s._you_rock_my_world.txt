i was at a funeral the day i realized
i wanted to spend my life with you
sitting down on the steps at the old post office
the flag was flying at half-mast

and i was thinkin' 'bout how everyone is dying
and maybe it's time to live

i don't know where we're going
i don't know what we'll do

walked into the thriftee
saw a man with the hollow eyes
who didn't give me all my change
but it didn't bother me this time
'cause i know i've only got this moment
and it's good

i went to the gas station
old woman honked her horn
waiting for me to fix her car

i don't know where we're going
i don't know what we'll do

laying in bed tonight i'm was thinking
and listening to all the dogs
and the sirens and the shots

and how a careful man tries to dodge the bullets
while a happy man takes a walk

and maybe it's time to live
