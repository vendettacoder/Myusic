i was standing in the station
being pounded by the rain
so i chose the last compartment
of a stationary train
felt someone get in behind me
but i never caught their eye
but i thought i heard a woman's voice
whispering goodbye

so i lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and i stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
and although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
i'm sure i heard a woman's voice cry

don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb
it's over and done
i'll never be under your thumb forever

so i rolled myself a cigarette
and smoked it on my own
but it didn't stop the whispers
or the smell of her cologne
then she rose up out of nowhere
and her hair was full of steam
and she stuck her head out the window
and screamed and screamed, she screamed!

don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb
it's over and done
i'll never be under your thumb forever

so i picked up an old newspaper to read
and i noticed something very strange indeed
so i looked a little closer
and it chilled me to the bone
woman throws herself from speeding train,
identity unknown
but i recognized the picture of the woman who was dead
and underneath the picture it said

don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb
it's over and done
i'll never be under your thumb forever

don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb forever
don't wanna be under your thumb
it's over and done
i'll never be under your thumb forever
