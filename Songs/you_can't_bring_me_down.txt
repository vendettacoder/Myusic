what the hell's going on around here?

first off let's take it from the start
straight out can't change what's in my heart
no one can tear my beliefs apart
you can't bring me

you ain't never seen no one like me
prevail regardless what the cost might be
power flows inside of me
you can't bring me

never fall as long as i try
refuse to be a part of your lie
even if it means i die
you can't bring me

you can't bring me down!

who the hell you calling crazy? 
you wouldn't know what crazy was if charles manson was eating fruit loops on your front porch

time out-let's get something clear
i speak-more truth than you want to hear
scapegoat to cover up your fear
you can't bring me

you ain't never seen so much might
fight for what i know is right
what up? you got yourself a fight
you can't bring me

stand up we'll all sing along
together ain't nothin' as strong
won't quit
we ain't in the wrong,
you can't bring me

you can't bring me down!
bring me down
you can't bring me down!
bring me down
you can't bring me down, no!
bring me down
you can't bring me down!
bring me down
you can't bring me down
you can't bring me down!

tell them what's up rocky!

you can't bring me down!
bring me down
you can't bring me down!
bring me down
you can't bring me down, no!
bring me down
you can't bring me down!
bring me down
you can't bring me down,
you can't bring me down!

so why you trying to bring me?
well you can't bring me down
no, no, no, no
can't bring me down
no, no, no, no, no, no
can't bring me down
no, no, no, no, no, no
can't bring me down
no, no, no, no, no, no
so why you trying to bring?
well you can't bring me down

just 'cause you don't understand what's going on
don't mean it don't make no sense
and just 'cause you don't like it,
don't mean it ain't no good
and let me tell you something;

before you go taking a walk in my world
you better take a look at the real world
'cause this ain't no mister roger's neighborhood

can you say "feel like shit"?
yeah maybe sometimes i do feel like shit
i ain't happy 'bout it, but i'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit!

and if i offended you
oh i'm sorry
but maybe you need to be offended
but here's my apology and one more thing 
fuck you!

'cause you can't bring me down!

bring me down
you can't bring me down!

you can't bring me down, no!

can't bring me down!
