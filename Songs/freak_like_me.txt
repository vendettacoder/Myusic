mutya: 
let me lay it on the line
i've got a little freakiness inside
and you know that a man has gotta deal with it
i don't care what they say
i'm not about to pay nobody's way
coz it's all about the dog in me

heidi: 
i wanna freak in the morning
freak in the evening (mutya: just like me)
i need a rough-neck brother that can satisfy me (mutya: just for me)
if you are that kinda man
coz baby i'm that kinda girl
i've got a freaky secret
everybody sing
coz we don't give a damn about a thing

all:
coz i will be your freak until the day
until the dawn
and we can
all through the night
to the early morn'
come on and i will take you round the hood
on a gangsta lean
coz we can
anytime of day
its all good for me

keisha: 
boy you're moving kind of slow
you gotta keep up now
there you go
that's just one thing that a man must do,hmm
i'm packing all the flavours you need
i got you shook
up on your knees
coz it's all about the dog in me

heidi: 
i'm gonna freak in the morning
a freak in the evening (keisha: just like me)
