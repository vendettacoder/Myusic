was an honest man
asked me for the phone
tried to take control
oh, i don't see it that way
i don't see it that way

oh, we shared some ideas
all obsessed with fame
says we're all the same
oh, i don't see it that way
i don't see it that way

raised in carolina
"i'm not like that"
tryin' to remind her
when we go back

i missed the last bus, i'll take the next train
i try but you see, it's hard to explain
i say the right things but act the wrong way
i like it right here but i cannot stay
i watch the tv, forget what i'm told
well i am too young and they are too old
the joke is on you, this place is a zoo
"you're right it's true"

says he can't decide
shake my head to say
"everything's just great"
oh, i just can't remember
i just can't remember

raised in carolina, she says
"i'm not like that"
tryin' to remind her
when we go back

i say the right things but act the wrong way
i like it right here but i cannot stay
i watch the tv, forget what i'm told
well i am too young and they are too old
oh, man, can't you see? i'm nervous, so please
pretend to be nice, so i can be mean
i missed the last bus, we take the next train
i try but you see, it's hard to explain
