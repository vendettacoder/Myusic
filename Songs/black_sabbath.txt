what is this that stands before me?
figure in black which points at me
turn 'round quick and start to run
find out i'm the chosen one
oh, no

big black shape with eyes of fire
telling people their desire
satan sitting there he's smiling
watches those flames get higher and higher
oh, no, no, please god help me

is it the end my friend?
satan's coming 'round the bend
people running 'cause they're scared
the people better go and beware
no, no, please, no
