she used to work in a diner
never saw a woman look finer
i used to order just to watch her float across the floor
she grew up in a small town
never put her roots down
daddy always kept movin', so she did too.

somewhere on a desert highway
she rides a harley-davidson
her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind
she's been runnin' half her life
the chrome and steel she rides
collidin' with the very air she breathes
the air she breathes.

you know it ain't easy
you got to hold on
she was an unknown legend in her time
now she's dressin' two kids
lookin' for a magic kiss
she gets the far-away look in her eyes.

somewhere on a desert highway
she rides a harley-davidson
her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind
she's been runnin' half her life
the chrome and steel she rides
collidin' with the very air she breathes
the air she breathes.
