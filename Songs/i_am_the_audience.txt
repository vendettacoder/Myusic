i am the audience 
there's no doubt, no consequence 
i could make the morning papers 
if i use my capers 
let's be the audience 
i might lose my patience 
polite applause excepted 
to the ones selected, as the audience... 

oh i ... am the audience 
no doubt, no consequence 
cause i'm the audience 

let's be the audience 
i might lose my patience 
polite applause excepted 
to the ones selected 
i am the audience 
breakdown the pretence 
no longer be silent 
let's turn to violence 

i am the audience
