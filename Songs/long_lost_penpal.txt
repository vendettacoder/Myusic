hello
do you remember me?
i am your long lost pen pal
it must have been ten years ago we last wrote
i don't really know what happened
i guess life came in the way
let me know if you're still alive
let me know if you ever used that knife or not

hello
yes, i remember you
i've got a husband and two children now
i work as an accountant and make fairly good money
i still have your letters, you used a pink pen to write them
and you would comfort me
when my tears would stain the ink
and i would send you mix tapes with kate bush on

i have to admit i sometimes lied in those letters
tried to make life better than it was
i still wasn't kissed at sixteen
and i still need a friend

there was this letter
i never told you this back then
but it would be fair to say it saved my life
i sat in the window
the only one left out from a party again
pretty sure i didn't have a single friend
then i checked the mailbox

dear long lost penpal
i was lying the whole time
i'm really a 46 years old man named luke
i have three children
and a wife, she doesn't care
and i hope you don't resent me
and i hope you do not hate me
for trying to find my way back to what it's like to be young

i have to admit i sometimes lied in those letters
tried to make life better than it was
i still wasn't kissed at sixteen
and i still need a friend
