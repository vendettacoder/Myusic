you know i live a life of danger for the fbi
keeping tabs on our nation on the land, on the sea, in the sky
but every single night before i go to bed
i get down on my knees and thank god
i'm a secret agent man

secret agent man, secret agent man
they've given me a number
but they've taken away my name

i got one hell of a job to perform for the u.s. of a
got the responsibility of our nation's top security
but every night and day, i salute the flag and say,
"thank you, jesus," 'cause i'm
i'm a secret agent man

secret agent man, secret agent man
they've given me a number
but they've taken away my name

you know they got me doin' this, doin' that
and a little bit of something else
fighting cavities of evil and safeguarding america's health
but not an afternoon passes i don't get up off my ass
thank you, god, 'cause i'm
i'm a secret agent man

secret agent man, secret agent man
they've given me a number
but they've taken away my name

'cause i'm a secret agent man
