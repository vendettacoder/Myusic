well it's been ten years and a thousand tears
and look at the mess i'm in
a broken nose and a broken heart,
an empty bottle of gin
well i sit and i pray
in my broken down chevrolet
while i'm singin' to myself
there's got to be another way

take away, take away
take away this ball and chain
well i'm lonely and i'm tired
and i can't take any more pain
take away, take away
never to return again
take away, take away
take away
take away this ball and chain

well i've searched and i've searched
to find the perfect life
a brand new car and a brand new suit
i even got me a little wife
but wherever i have gone
i was sure to find myself there
you can run all your life
but not go anywhere 

take away, take away
take away this ball and chain
well i'm sick and i'm tired
and i can't take any more pain
take away, take away
never to return again
take away, take away
take away
take away this ball and chain

well i'll pass the bar on the way
to my dingy hotel room
i spent all my money
i've been drinkin' since half past noon
well i'll wake there in the mornin'
or maybe in the county jail
times are hard getting harder
i'm born to lose and destined to fail 

take away, take away
take away this ball and chain
well i'm lonely and i'm tired
and i can't take any more pain
take away, take away
never to return again
take away, take away
take away
take away this ball and chain
