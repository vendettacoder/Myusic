i got a certain little girl, she's on m-my mind
no doubt about it, she looks so fine
she's the best girl that i ever had
sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad

na na na na na na na na na na

hush, hush
i thought i heard her calling my name now
hush, hush
she broke my heart, but i love her just the same now
hush, hush
i thought i heard her calling my name now
hush, hush
i need her loving and i'm not to blame now

(love, love)
they got it early in the morning
(love, love)
they got it late in the evening
(love, love)
well, i want that, need it
(love, love)
oh, i gotta, gotta have it

she's got loving like quicksand
only took one touch of her hand
to blow my mind and i'm in so deep
that i can't eat, y'all, and i can't sleep

listen
hush, hush
i thought i heard her calling my name now
hush, hush
she broke my heart, but i love her just the same now
hush, hush
thought i heard her calling my name now
hush, hush
i need her loving and i'm not to blame now

(love, love)
they got it early in the morning
(love, love)
they got it late in the evening
(love, love)
well, i want that, need it
(love, love)
hey, i gotta, gotta have it
