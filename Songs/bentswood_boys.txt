when you're high on diesel nightly
and the traffic starts to roll
you smoke a cigarette and watch the black girls
in a white boys world

anything is possible 
for the bentswood boys

where the karma comes with the kids and the cat food
you see tina push the pram
'cos she was on her back in his estate car
and in the back of his van

anything is possible 
for the bentswood boys

for the bentswood boys 
(things are happening)
for the bentswood boys 
(mmm... tell it like it is!)

don't take me down, don't take me down
don't take me down south 
don't take me down, don't take me down
don't take me down south 
don't take me down, don't take me down
don't take me down south 
don't take me down, don't take me down
don't take me down south
