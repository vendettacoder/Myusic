i was searching through the record section
of a shop in birmingham
trying to forget the news

but you know how things sometimes are
the fates conspire to
remind you

'no return' was its title
'no return' like i'd said
'no return', those searing words
burning in my head

i'd come across a compilation
called 'blues in a minor chord'
as though you were there behind me

i'd turned it over to read the sleeve notes,
credits in a daze
and a chill came up my spine

'no return' was its title
'no return' like you'd said
'no return', those piercing words
tattered in my head

and i'd said,
"the pain of being together
is more than being apart"
i thought of you all december long
and now it's a new year's start
"the loneliness of walking by your side
is more than walking alone"
it's why i'm leaving

i let out a hollow howling
falling terribly
like wind escaping from a tube

i think they call it coincidence
or something like deja vu
you never believe it 'til it happens to you

'no return' was its title
'no return' like we'd said
'no return', like icicles
falling through our heads

and i'd said,
"the pain of being together
is more than being apart"
i thought of you all december long
and now it's a new year's start
"the loneliness of walking by your side
is more than walking alone"
it's why i'm leaving

it's why i'm leaving
it's why i'm leaving
it's why i'm leaving...
