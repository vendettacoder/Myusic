darkness, darkness
be my pillow
take my hand
and let me sleep
in the coolness of your shadow
in the silence of your deep

darkness, darkness
hide my yearning
for the things i cannot be
keep my mind from constant turning
toward the things i cannot see now
things i cannot see now
things i cannot see

darkness, darkness,
long and lonesome,
ease the day that brings me pain.
i have felt the edge of sadness,
i have known the depth of fear.
darkness, darkness, be my blanket,
cover me with the endless night,
take away, take away the pain of knowing,
fill the emptiness of right now,
emptiness of right now, now, now
emptiness of ri-ight now.

darkness, darkness, be my pillow,
take my hand, and let me sleep.
in the coolness of your shadow,
in the silence, the silence of your deep.
darkness, darkness, be my blanket,
cover me with the endless night,
take away, take away the pain of knowing
fill the emptiness of right now,
emptiness of right now now now
emptiness of right....
oh yeah oh yeah
emptiness, emptiness
oh yeah
