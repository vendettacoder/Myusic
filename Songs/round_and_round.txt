it's always the same as always
sad and tongue tied
it's got a memory and refrain

i'm afraid, you're afraid
and we die and we live
and we're born again
turn me inside out
what can i say?

(merry go round)
up and around we go     
round and around we go   (x4)

break down, break down

you play air guitars for a fan
and i, i'll play the eardrums in the band
and i'll back you up as your frontman

"hello? oh, hi"
now that sounds right frontman
write the songs that say, "i like that!"

hold on, i'm calling, calling back to the bowl
and we'll dazzle them all, hold on

pick up the phone
and i'll want to go home now

(merry go round)
up and around we go
round and around we go

lady... come on lee, set me free
come on me!

sentimental heartbreaking
everything is my fault.
