you had something to hide
should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
now you're not satisfied
with what you're being put through

it's just time to pay the price
for not listening to advice
and deciding in your youth
on the policy of truth

things could be so different now
it used to be so civilized
you will always wonder how
it could have been if you'd only lied

it's too late to change events
it's time to face the consequence
for delivering the proof
in the policy of truth

never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before

now you're standing there, tongue tied
you'd better learn your lesson well
hide what you have to hide
and tell what you have to tell

you'll see your problems multiplied
if you continually decide
to faithfully pursue
the policy of truth

never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
