sometimes i wonder, did i make a mistake
when i brought you to the south
gonna send you back to walker
girl, that's where you belong
since you been got in the big city
well you been started treatin' me wrong

your mama and your daddy done told me baby
not to bring you to the south
i brought you to the city
and the bright lights knocked you out
i'm gonna send you back to walker
girl that's where you belong, i know
since you been got in the big city
well you been started treatin' me wrong...

your mama and your daddy done told me baby
not to bring you to the south

and the bright lights knocked you out

well you been started treatin' me wrong
