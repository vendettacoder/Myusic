'scuse me girl, i know it's a bit... embarrassing but i just noticed some tan lines on your shirt...

see i reckon you about an eight or a nine 
maybe even nine and a half in 4 beers' time 
that blue top shirt top you've got on, is nice 
bit too much fake tan though but, yea you score high 
but there's just one little thing that's just really really really really annoying me about you, ya see 
yeah yeah like i said, you are really fit 
but my gosh! don't you just know it 

i'm not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
you're fit but my gosh don't you know it 

so when i looked at you standing there with your horde 
i was waiting in the queue lookin' at the board 
wondering whether to have a burger or chips 
or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford 
when i noticed out o' the corner of my eye 
lookin' toward my direction your eyes locked on my course 
i couldn't concentrate on what i wanted to order 
which lost me my place in the queue i waited for, yeah 

i'm not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
you're fit but my gosh don't you know it 

woa 
leave it out 
are you smoking crack or something? 
leave it out 
mike just leave it, just leave it
we cannot have that behaviour in this establishment 
it's not worth it mike 
leave it out 
just leave it 
don't touch me 
leave it out
don't touch me i'm alright 
don't...look i'm alright... 

for a while there i was thinkin', yeah but what if 
picturing myself pulling with bare white-heart wit
staring as you standing there opposite 
whether or not you knew it i swear you didn't tick 
and when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing was clocking onto you too, yeah 
i had to admit
that yea yea you are fit and yeah i do want it 
but i stopped sharkin' a minute to get chips and drinks 

i'm not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
you're fit but my gosh don't you know it 

now, i bashed my head hard earlier, due to the brew, 
but i am digressing slightly so i'll continue 
i didn't wanna bowl over all geezer and rude 
not rude like good but just rude like uncouth 
you girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you 
well let me tell you see yes yes you are really rude 
and rude as in good i knew she said as she queued 
but i just did not wanna give the satisfaction to you 

i'm not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
your fit but my gosh don't you know it 

oi just as you started to make your big advance 
with the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand 
i was like "nah, i can't even, no you look grand"
but you looked sharp there smiling hard suggesting and, 
leaning away with your hearty hearty lookin' tan 
but i admit the next bit was spanners to my plan 
you walked toward my path but just brushed right past 
and into the arms of that fucking white shirted man 

i'm not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
you're fit but my gosh don't you know it 

what do i give a fuck i've got a girlfriend anyway 
(woah! we've all had a drink mate!) 
oi were all a bit drunk we've had a few fair play 
i've got this stella i bombed from that last cafe 
this nights not even begun 
yes yes oh yay 

i did fancy you a bit though, yea i must say 
i would rather i hadn't mugged myself on display 
but this is just another case of female stopping play 
in an otherwise total result of a holiday 

i'm not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
you're fit but my gosh don't you know it 

haha
heh heh heh! 

you're fit but you know it!! 
you're fit but you know it!! 
i think i'm going to fall over!! 
i think i'm going to fall o... 

fuckin' 'ell!
