i'm your top prime cut of meat, i'm your choice,
i wanna be elected,
i'm your yankee doodle dandy in a gold rolls royce,
i wanna be elected,
kids want a savior, don't need a fake,
i wanna be elected,
we're all gonna rock to the rules that i make,
i wanna be elected, elected, elected.

good evening mr &amp; mrs america and all ships at sea,
the candidate is taking the country by storm.

i never lied to you, i've always been cool,
i wanna be elected,
i gotta get the vote, and i told you 'bout school,
i wanna be elected, elected, elected,
hallelujah, i wanna be selected,
everyone in the united states of america.

we're gonna win this one, take the country by storm,
we're gonna be elected,
you and me together, young and strong,
we're gonna be elected, elected, elected,
respected, selected, call collected,
i wanna be elected, elected.

"and if i am elected
i promise the formation of a new party
a third party, the wild party!
i know we have problems,
we got problems right here in central city,
we have problems on the north, south, east and west,
new york city, saint louis, philadelphia, los angeles, detroit, chicago,
everybody has problems,
and personally, i don't care."
