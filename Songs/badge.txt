thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
thinkin' that i might have drove you too far
and i'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table

i told you not to wander 'round in the dark
i told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
then i told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to mabel

yes, i told you that the light goes up and down
don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
and you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
before they bring the curtain down
yes, before they bring the curtain down, woo-ooh

get up, get up, get up
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
she didn't have the time to wait in the queue
she cried away her life since she fell off the cradle
