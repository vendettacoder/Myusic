you say my love for you's not real
but you don't know how real it feels
all i want to do is to spend some time with you
so i can hold you, hold you

your sister says that i'm no good
i'd reassure her if i could
all i want to do is to spend some time with you
so i can hold you, hold you

plans fail every day
i'd want to hear you say
your love won't be leaving
your eyes aren't deceiving

fears will soon fade away
smile now, don't be afraid
all i want to do is to spend some time with you
so i can hold you, hold you

so let me whisper in your ear
don't you worry they can't hear
all i want to do is to spend some time with you
so i can hold you, hold you
