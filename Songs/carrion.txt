carry on inside of your heart
under the brine you won't notice the dark
can stone and steel and horses heels ever explain the way you feel
from scapa flow to rotherhithe, i felt the lapping of an ebbing tide

oh the heavy water how it enfolds
the salt, the spray, the gorgeous undertow
always, always, always the sea
brilliantine mortality

so irrigate your heart until you know you're complete
and you're draped in kelp, below by 8,000 feet
my soul she cried i thought you'd died amid fumes of formaldehyde
you have been gone for so long i felt the lapping of an ebbing tide

oh the heavy water how it enfolds
the salt, the spray, the gorgeous undertow
always, always, always the sea
brilliantine mortality

when this corpus christic isle became a land of ocean blue
again, she cried, you turned my eye,
at mentions of, no matter why,
and in the end, an august sun,
and one by one we blew
until the devil screamed in the evermore
in envy of the grace we saw

oh the heavy water how it enfolds
the salt, the spray, the gorgeous undertow
always, always, always the sea
brilliantine mortality
