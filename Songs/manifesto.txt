i am for a life around the corner
that takes you by surprise
that comes leaves all you need
and more besides
i am for a life and time by numbers
blast in fast 'n' low
add 'em up, account for luck
you never know
i am into friendship and plain sailing
through frenzied ports o' call
o shake the hand to beat the band
with love is all
or nothing to the man who wants tomorrow
there's one in every town
a crazy guy, he'd rather die
than be tied down
i am for the man who drives the hammer
to rock you 'til the grave
his power drill shocks
a million miles away
i am for the revolution's coming
i don't know where she's been
for those who dare because it's there
i know i've seen
now and then i've suffered imperfection
i've studied marble flaws
and faces drawn pale and worn
by many tears
i am that i am from out of nowhere
to fight without a cause
roots strain against the grain
with brute force you'd better
hold out when you're in doubt
question what you see
and when you find an answer
bring it home to me.
