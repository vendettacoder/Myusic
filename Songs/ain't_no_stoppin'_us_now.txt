ain't no stoppin' us now
we're on the move
ain't no stoppin' us now
we've got the groove

there's been so many things
that's held us down
but now it looks like
things are finally comin' around

i know we've got
a long, long way to go
and where we'll end up
i don't know

but we won't let nothin' hold us back
we're putting ourselves together
we're polishing up our act

if you've ever been held down before
i know you refuse to be held down anymore

don't you let nothing, nothing
stand in your way
i want y'all to listen, listen
to every word i say, every word i say

ain't no stoppin' us now
we're on the move
ain't no stoppin' us now
we've got the groove

ain't no stoppin' us now
we're on the move
(i know, i know)
ain't no stoppin' us now
we've got the groove
(we've got it)

i know you know someone
that has a negative vibe
and if you're trying to make it
they only push you aside

they really don't have
nowhere to go
ask them where they're going
they don't know

but we won't let nothin' hold us back
we're gonna put ourselves together
gonna polish up our act
if you've ever been held down before
i know you refuse to be held down anymore

don't you let nothing, nothing
stand in your way
i want y'all to listen, listen
to every word i say, every word i say

ain't no stoppin' us now
(no, no, no)
we're on the move!
(movin', groovin')
ain't no stoppin' us now
we've got the groove
(movin', groovin')

ain't no stoppin' us now
we're on the move
(i know we've got the groove)
ain't no stoppin' us now
we've got the groove
