we're setting sail 
to the place on the map 
from which no one has ever returned 
drawn by the promise of the joker and the fool 
by the light of the crosses that burn 
drawn by the promise of the women and the lace 
and the gold and the cotton and pearls 
it's the place where they keep all the darkness you need 
you sail away from the light of the world 
on this trip, baby 

you will pay tomorrow 
you're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
you will pay tomorrow 

save me 
save me from tomorrow 
i don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no
oh, save me 
save me from tomorrow 
i don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no

i want to run and hide 
right now

avarice and greed 
are gonna drive you over the endless sea 
they will leave you drifting in the shallows 
or drowning in the oceans of history 
traveling the world, you're in search of no good 
but i'm sure you'll build your sodom, like you knew you would 
using all the good people for your galley slaves 
as your little boat struggles through the warning waves 

but you don't pay 
you will pay tomorrow 
you're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
you gonna pay tomorrow 

save me 
save me from tomorrow 
i don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no, no
oh, save me 
save me from tomorrow 
i don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no, no

where's it coming from? 
oh, where's it going to? 
it's just a 
it's just a ship of fools

here we go
all aboard
