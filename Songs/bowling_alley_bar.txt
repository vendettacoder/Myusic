dented cars make me think of you
sitting on a red leather stool
drinking with your sunglasses on
in the bowling alley bar

and the sound of crashing pins
behind us when we kissed
the night i wrecked my father's car
behind the bowling alley bar

i'm so sorry, donna
sorry about your sunglasses
i didn't mean to step on them
i didn't mean to laugh when you cried

'cause it was never a waste of time
to drink beer by your side
and watch the fallen pins
set upright again

skinny girls in tight red jeans
kicking cigarette machines
that old woman all alone
dirty dancing by the phones

driving circles at three am
throwing rocks at mailboxes
you could never see the stars
with those plastic sunglasses on

but it was never a waste of time
to get drunk by your side
and watch the fallen pins
set upright again
