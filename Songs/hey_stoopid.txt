hey bro, take it slow
you ain't livin' in a video
youre flying low with a high velocity
no doubt, you're stressin' out
that ain't what rock'n'roll is about
get off that one way trip down lonely street

now i know you've been kicked around
you ain't alone in this ugly town
you stick a needle in your arm
you bite the dust, you buy the farm

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
what ya tryin' to do
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
they win you lose
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

c'mon girl, it's a better day
get your foot out of that grave
don't let that one love tear your world apart
c'mon babe, kick that stuff
show the street it ain't so tough
quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart

now i know you've been seeing red
don't put a pistol to your head
sometimes your answers heaven sent
your way is so damn permanent

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
what ya tryin' to do
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
they win you lose
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

this ain't your daddy talkin'
you know, i know
your story ain't so shocking
you know, i know
blow some steam
c'mon and scream

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
what ya tryin' to do
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
they win you lose
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
