you can tell gail, if she calls
that i'm famous now for all of these rock and roll songs
and even if that's a lie
she shoulda given me a try

when we were kids on the field of the first day of school
i would've been her fool
and i would've sang out your name in those old high school halls
you tell that to gail, if she calls

and you can tell jane, if she writes
that i'm drunk off all these stars and all these crazy hollywood nights
and that's total deceit
but she shoulda married me

and tell her i spent every night of my youth on the floor
bleeding out from all these wounds
i would've gotten her right out of that town she despised
you tell that to janie, if she writes

but boys will be boys and girls have those eyes
that'll cut you to ribbons sometimes
and all you can do is just wait by the moon
and bleed if it's what she says you oughta do

you remind anna, if she asks why
that a thief stole my heart while she was making up her mind
i heard she lives in brooklyn with the cool
and goes crazy over that new york scene on 7th avenue

but i used to wait at the diner a million nights without her
praying she won't cancel again tonight
and the waiter served my coffee with a consolation sigh
you remind anna, if she asks why

tell her it's all right
you know it's hard to tell you this
oh it's hard to tell you this
here's looking at you, kid
