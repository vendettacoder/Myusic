i want to give you devotion, i want to give you devotion
i want to give you devotion, hooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-ooh...
i want to give you devotion

i want to give you a place to release your feelings, a star beat rhythm with a standard meaning
a word and a message with a lot of emotion, with total dedication and a lot of devotion
and a lot of devotion, i want to give you devotion

well let's start here at the beginning of my lyric, to be too bad to rhyme is not a merit
to rock to roll for soul is what i aim for, wait till i hit the goal and that's a top score
some tunes are long others with an ease, to write my rhyme in line when there's a cool breeze
keepin' on and on and on and on till you get the job son, job's nearly done

hooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-ooh...
i want to give you devotion, i want to give you devotion
total dedication and a lot of devotion, hooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-ooh...

well magical moments, moments are magical, star call, mystical, logical, lyrical
magical moments are meant to be kept, don't erase them from your brain i need to inject
i have a dream, but there's a nightmare inside, it's getting me uptight for the sight is a fright
'cause the night creeps in, creepin', creepin', slowly gassin', frightnin', spooky
'cause a frightnin' nightmare can terrorize, poll tax came and up went the rise
open your eyes and realize i'm a truly disguise, like hawk the slayer he came and caught me
maggie came but now she's slaughtered

i want to give you devotion
so don't use abuse or lose you're like flotex, rock the mike to the disc and don't get upset
rhyme in time to the finest quality, that's the time when you know that you're a mc
m i k double e, takin' it down now
