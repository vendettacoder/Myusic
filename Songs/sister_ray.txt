doug and sally inside
they're busy cooking for the down five
who're staring at miss rayon
who's busy licking up her big man

i'm searching for my mainline
i said i couldn't hit it sideways
i said i couldn't hit it sideways
ah, it's just like sister ray said

rosy and miss rayon
they're busy waiting for her booster
who just got back from carolina
she said she didn't like the weather

they're busy waiting for her sailor
whose dick is just as big as ever
he's just here from alabama
he wants to know a way to earn a dollar

i'm searching for my mainline
i said i couldn't hit it sideways
i couldn't hit it sideways
ah, just like sister ray said

cecil's got his new piece
he cocks and shoots between three and four
he aims it at the sailor
shoots him down dead on the floor

oh, you shouldn't do that
don't you know you'll stain the carpet
don't you know you'll stain the carpet
and by the way man, have you got a dollar

oh no man, i haven't got the time time
too busy sucking on a ding dong
she's busy sucking on my ding dong
oh, she does it just like sister ray said

i'm searching for my mainline
i said i couldn't hit it sideways
i couldn't hit it sideways
oh, just like, just like sister ray said

now, who's that knocking
who's that knocking on my chamber door
now could it be the police
they've come to take me for a ride ride

oh, but i haven't got the time time
too busy sucking on my ding dong
she's busy sucking on my ding dong
oh, now, just like sister ray said

i'm searching for my mainline
i couldn't hit it sideways
i couldn't hit it sideways
oh now, just like, just like, just like.....   sister ray says
