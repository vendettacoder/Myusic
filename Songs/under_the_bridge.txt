sometimes i feel like i don't have a partner
sometimes i feel like my only friend
is the city i live in, the city of angels
lonely as i am, together we cry

i drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
i walk through her hills 'cause she knows who i am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
well, i never worry, now that is a lie

and i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way
i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way

yeah, yeah-yeah

it's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
it's hard to believe that i'm all alone
at least i have her love, the city, she loves me
lonely as i am, together we cry

well, i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way
well, i don't ever want to feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love, take me all the way

yeah, yeah-yeah
oh, no, no, no, yeah-yeah
love me, i said, yeah, yeah

one time

under the bridge downtown
is where i drew some blood
under the bridge downtown
i could not get enough
under the bridge downtown
forgot about my love
under the bridge downtown
i gave my life away

yeah, yeah-yeah (away)
oh, no, no, no, no, yeah-yeah (away)
alone, i said, oh yeah-yeah (away)
will i stay?
