we all ferment 
a face can change 
but souls stay young
we're all connected 
so take a journey with someone 
learn to be as one

still living, sinking, falling, twisting,
but i'm breathing you in, breathing you in
oxygen, oxygen

we all ferment 
a taste can change 
from days so young
you feel rejected 
just hold your head up to the sun 
learn to be as one

still living, sinking, falling, we're still living, drifting
i'm breathing you in, breathing you in
still living, sinking, feeding, twisting, i'm living
i'm breathing you in, breathing you in

disconnecting
oxygen, oxygen, oxygen

still living, sinking, falling, twisting
we're still living, i'm breathing you in, breathing you in
still living, sinking, falling, drifting
we're living, i'm breathing you in, breathing you in
i'm breathing you in, breathing you
