i hope that our few remaining friends
give up on trying to save us
i hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
to piss off the dumb few that forgave us

i hope the fences we mended
fall down beneath their own weight
and i hope we hang on past the last exit
i hope it's already too late

and i hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
someday burns down
and i hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
and i never come back to this town again

in my life, i hope i lie
and tell everyone you were a good wife
and i hope you die
i hope we both die

i hope i cut myself shaving tomorrow
i hope it bleeds all day long
our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
we're pretty sure they're all wrong

i hope it stays dark forever
i hope the worst isn't over
and i hope you blink before i do
and i hope i never get sober

and i hope when you think of me years down the line
you can't find one good thing to say
and i'd hope that if i found the strength to walk out
you'd stay the hell out of my way

i am drowning, there is no sign of land
you are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hand
and i hope you die
i hope we both die
