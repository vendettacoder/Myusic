once upon a time 
science opened up the door 
we would feed the hungriy fields 
tilll they could'nt eat no more 

but the potion that we made 
touched the creatures down below 
and they grow up in a way 
that we'd never seen before 
supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature 

they were angry with the man 
cause changed their way of life 
and they take their sweet revenge 
as they trample throught the night 

for hundred miles or more 
you could hear the people cry 
but there is nothing you can do 
even god is on their side 
god is on, god is on, god is on their side 
supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature 

cars will break the light 
come flowing in the air 
the creature will decide 
who goes where 
how can i explain 
things are different today 
darkness all around 
no one makes a sound 
such a sad affaire 
no one seems to care 
supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature 

better watch out 
there's no way to stop it now 
you can't escape it's too late 
look what you've done 
there's no place that you can run 
the monsters made, we must pray 

maybe nature has a plan 
to control the way of man 
he must start from scratch again 
many battles must he win 
till he earns his place on earth 
like the other creatures do 
will there be a happy end 
now that all depends on you 
supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature
