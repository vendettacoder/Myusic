why don't you play the tune now?
i don't like music.
come on you little geezer.
you'll look funny when you're fifty.

somebody i never met but in a way i know
didn't think that you could get so much from a picture show
man dies first reel
people ask what's the deal?
this ain't how it's supposed to be
don't like no aborigine

took a trip in powis square
pop star dyed his hair
no fans to scream and shout
when mobsters came to flush him out
gangland slaying underground
new identity must be found
on the left bank for a while
insanity bohemian style

ritual ideas relativity
only buildings, no people prophecy
time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho

met a dwarf that was no good
dressed like little red riding hood
bad habit taking life
calling card a six-inch knife
ran off really fast
mumbled something 'bout the past
best sex i've ever seen
as if each moment was the last
drops of blood, colour slide
funeral for his bride
but it's him who's really dead
gets to take the funeral ride

ritual ideas relativity
only buildings, no people prophecy
time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-oh, oh-ho, oh-ho

you know, i don't think  i'm gonna let you stay in the film business.

i like a bit of a cavort.
i don't answer solicitor's letters.
i apply a bit of pressure.

space guy fell from the sky
scratched my head and wondered why
time slides into time
across international dateline
scientist eats bubblegum
hall of fame, baseball
senator's a hoodlum
big chiefs in the hall

ritual ideas relativity
only buildings, no people prophecy
time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho

stray thoughts fear to tread
placed upon the screen instead
she's my flame too hot to hold
had to settle for her cold

bloodlust, greek god, gold discovery
gone bust, tight wad, slow recovery
axe job, flame thrower, iron bar and gun
betting shop, new owner, a walk in the sun

ritual ideas relativity
only buildings, no people prophecy
time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho

spread the news: the maestro's back
with a beat-box soundtrack
the king of brains - queen of the sack
executives have heart attack
it's assault course celluloid
the money makers would avoid
sometimes notions get reversed
centre of the universe

ritual ideas relativity
only buildings, no people prophecy
time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
