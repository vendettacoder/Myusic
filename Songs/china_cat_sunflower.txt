look for awhile 
at the china cat sunflower
proud-walking jingle 
in the midnight sun

copper-dome bodhi 
drip a silver kimono
like a crazy-quilt stargown
through a dream night wind

krazy kat peeking 
through a lace bandana
like a one-eyed cheshire
like a diamond-eye jack

a leaf of all colors plays
a golden string fiddle
to a double-e waterfall 
over my back

comic book colors 
on a violin river
crying leonardo words
from out a silk trombone

i rang a silent bell
beneath a shower of pearls
in the eagle wing palace
of the queen chinee
