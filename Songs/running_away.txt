i am, i, i feel
i am, i

i close my eyes and make a wish
for inner peace and tranquility inside
my mind, i feel it's changing
breaking down the defenses of my heart

it's like a new adventure
and this is my life
no longer know the girl inside
the stranger in my mind

i'm running away, running away from you
though i beg you to stay, i'm running away from you
i'm running away

from predictable, miss reliable, so methodical
wanna be individual and original
so radical and desirable

put a message in a bottle
watch it sail across the ocean blue
so free of limitations
a vision, i can only fantasize

i'm floating in a new direction
as this is my life
no longer know the girl inside
the stranger in my mind

i'm running away, i'm running away from you
though i beg you to stay, i'm running away from you
i'm running away

from predictable, miss reliable, so methodical
wanna be individual and original
so radical and desirable

no longer know the girl inside
no longer know the girl inside
no longer know the girl inside
the stranger in my mind

i'm running away, i'm running away, running away from you
though i beg you to stay, i'm running away from you
i'm running away

from predictable, miss reliable, so methodical
wanna be individual and original
so radical and desirable

running away, i'm running away from you
though i beg you to stay, i'm running away from you
running away

i am, i, i feel
i am, i
