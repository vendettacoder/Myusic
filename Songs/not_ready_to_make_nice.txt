forgive? sounds good
forget? i'm not sure i could
they say time heals everything
but i'm still waiting

i'm through with doubt
there's nothing left for me to figure out
i've paid a price
and i'll keep paying

i'm not ready to make nice
i'm not ready to back down
i'm still mad as hell and
i don't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
it's too late to make it right
i probably wouldn't if i could
'cause i'm mad as hell
can't bring myself to do what it is you think i should

i know you said
"can't you just get over it?"
it turned my whole world around
and i kind of like it

i made my bed and i sleep like a baby
with no regrets and i don't mind sayin'
it's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
and how in the world can the words that i said
send somebody so over the edge
that they'd write me a letter
sayin' that i better 
shut up and sing or my life will be over

i'm not ready to make nice
i'm not ready to back down
i'm still mad as hell and
i don't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
it's too late to make it right
i probably wouldn't if i could
'cause i'm mad as hell
can't bring myself to do what it is you think i should
