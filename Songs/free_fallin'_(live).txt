stick to your voice

she's a good girl, loves her mama
loves jesus and america too
i'm a bad boy 'cause i don't even miss her
i'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

and i'm free, free fallin'
yes, i'm free, free fallin'

it's a long day livin' in reseda
there's a freeway running through the yard
she's a good girl, crazy 'bout elvis
loves horses and her boyfriend too

and i'm free, free fallin'
yes, i'm free, free fallin'

yes, i'm free, free fallin'
yes, i'm free, free fallin'

yes, i'm free, free fallin'
yes, i'm free, free fallin'
