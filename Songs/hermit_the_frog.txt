yeah i feel i'm watered down,
whenever he's around.
i put on the crown of clowns,
and melt slowly to the ground.

yeah i feel it coming on,
when i've been static for too long.
and an explosion comes in time,
before i go and cross the line.

they say you used to be so kind,
i never knew you had such a dirty mind.
well, i went to the doctors believing,
the devil had control over me.
and i was finding it hard to breath in,
finding it hard to fight the feeling.

when my heart just burst like a glass balloon,
and let it fly too high and it shattered too soon.
i was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room,
i broke my glass balloon.
i let go of my glass balloon.

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

they call him hermit the frog,
he's looking for a dog.
did you find your bitch in me?
oh you're abominable socially.
you're just a little bit too much like me.

she says you used to be so kind,
well baby i give you your dirty mind.
well i, i wanna tell you a secret.
you can take your double standard love and keep it.
i can't help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed,
and i can't help he sometimes like to come and rest his little head.

when my heart just burst like a glass balloon,
and let it fly too high and it shattered too soon.
i was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room,
i broke my glass balloon.
i let go of my glass balloon.

oh my heart just burst like a glass balloon,
we let them fly too high and they shattered too soon.
are we the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room?
we broke our glass balloons.
we let go of their glass balloons.
we broke our glass balloon.
let go of my glass balloon.
