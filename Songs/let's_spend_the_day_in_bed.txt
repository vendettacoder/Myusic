let's spend the day in bed
yeah that's what i said
let's lie down draw the shades
ditch the plans we made
rest your lovely bones
and just stay home

turn off the telephone
picnic on the sheets
toss the dogs some treats
rub each other's feet
we're not ashamed
of a little lazy love
till we're through
i'm gonna spend the day in bed with you

let's spend the day in bed
on our very own bed spread
a pajama holiday
catch a black and white matinee
spoon-feed these new daydreams
and just stay home

we'll read shel silverstein
where the sidewalk ends
smile about old friends
try to comprehend
one single day
no work and only play
kick off your shoes
i'm gonna spend the day in bed with you

when life's a drag we'll get stoned on love
stoned on love
just stay home
we'll get stoned on love
get stoned on love

we need a groove that's all our own
and we'll get stoned
just stay home
we'll get stoned on love
stoned on love

till we're through
i'm gonna spend the day in bed with you

let's spend the day in bed
forget all that i said
we'll eat your favorite pie
ice cream on the side
lie here a la mode
and just stay home
just stay home
just stay home

when life's a drag we'll get stoned on love
stoned on love
just stay home
we'll get stoned on love
get stoned on love

we need a groove that's all our own
and we'll get stoned
just stay home
we'll get stoned on love
stoned on love

when life's a drag we'll get stoned on love
stoned on love
just stay home
we'll get stoned on love
get stoned on love

we need a groove that's all our own
and we'll get stoned
just stay home
we'll get stoned on love
stoned on love

just stay home
