we don't need to be clever to learn your lies
we only have to listen, open up our eyes
try to be honest, get kicked in the face
but if you cheat you're just a rat in the race

i'm an upstart
hey whatcha gonna do
i'm an upstart
listen i'm talking to you

i'm an upstart
hey whatcha gonna do
i'm an upstart
listen i'm talking to you

seek out an identity
you alienate society
face the facts, why not admit it
how can you be outrageous when your mother won't allow it?

i'm an upstart
hey whatcha gonna do
i'm an upstart
listen i'm talking to you

i'm an upstart
hey whatcha gonna do
i'm an upstart
listen i'm talking to you

how can you be outrageous when your mother won't allow it?
