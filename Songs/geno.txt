geno! geno! geno! geno! geno! ...

back in '68 in a sweaty club
oh, geno
before jimmy's machine and the rocksteady rub
oh, geno

on a night when flowers didn't suit my shoes
after a week of flunkin' and bunkin' school
with the lowest head in the crowd that night
just practicin' steps and keepin' outta the fights

academic inspiration
you gave me none
but you were michael the lover
the fighter that won

but now just look at me
as i'm looking down at you
no, i'm not bein' flash
it's what i'm built to do

that man took the stage, his towel was swingin' high
oh, geno
this man was my bombers, my dexy's, my high
oh, geno

the crowd they all hailed you
and chanted your name
but they never knew like we knew
me and you were the same

and now you're all over
your song is so tame, brrrrr
you fed me, you bred me
i'll remember your name

academic inspiration
you gave me none
you were michael the lover
the fighter that won

and now just look at me
as i'm looking down at you
no, i'm not bein' flash
it's what i'm built to do

oh geno, woah geno
oh geno, woah geno
