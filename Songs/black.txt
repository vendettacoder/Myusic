i'm coming into your town
night is falling to the ground
but i can still see where you loved yourself
before he tore it all down. april 12th
with nobody else around; you were outside the house
(where's your mother?)

when he put you in the car
when he took you down the road
and i can still see where it was open
the door he slammed closed
it was open, the door he slammed closed. it was open, long ago

but don't lose me now, don't lose me now
though i know that i'm not useful anyhow
just let me stick around
and i tell you, like before
you should say his name the way that he said yours
you don't want to say his name any more
oh, cynda moore

baby daughter on the road
wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
well i can still see the cigarette's heat
can't believe all that you're telling me
what is cutting like the smoke through your teeth as you are telling me "forget it"

but if i could tear his throat
spill his blood between my jaws
and erase his name for good, don't you know that i would?
don't you realize i wouldn't pause
that i would cut him down with my claws
if i could have somehow never let that happen?
or i'll call, some black midnight, fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did
tell his brand-new wife and second kid
and i tell you, like before
you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
you want no part of his life any more
oh, cynda moore

don't lose me now, let me help you out
though i know that i can't help you anyhow
when i watch you i'm proud
when i tell you twice before
you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
you want no part of his life any more
oh, cynda moore
it'll never be the way it was before
but i wish that you would let me through that door
let me through that door
let me through that door
let me through that door, baby
