whenever you're near i hide my tears
behind a painted smile
you can't imagine the tears and sorrow
behind a painted smile

my life's a masquerade
a world of let's pretend, dear
since you took your love
pretending never ends, dear

but i can't let you know
that i still need you so, no

(darling i hide the tears that i cry)
whenever you're near i hide my tears
behind a painted smile
you can't imagine the tears and sorrow
behind a painted smile

i can't let you see
all the tears i'm crying
you would pity me --
that would be like dying

if i can't have your love
i don't need your sympathy

(darling i hide the tears that i cry)
whenever you're near i hide my tears
behind a painted smile
you can't imagine the tears and sorrow
behind a painted smile

my life is a masquerade
since you took your love away

whenever you're near i hide my tears
i just can't let you see
how much you hurting me

whenever you're near i hide my tears
behind a painted smile
