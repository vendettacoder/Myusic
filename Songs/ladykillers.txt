here we go, i'm hanging out in camden
drinking with my girlfriends on a saturday night 
this guy says, "come and meet my girlfriend" 
she's sitting in the corner, looking rather uptight

so i say, "hello," and i try to be nice 
but i see he's feeling itchy 
trying to play us off each other 
"girls, girls, please don't fight" 
(you get the picture)

hey you, the muscles and the long hair 
telling me that women are superior to men 
most guys just don't appreciate this 
you just try convincing me you're better than them

so he talks for hours 'bout his sensitive soul 
and his favourite subject is sex 
i don't even think he really wanted it 
but, christ, this guy's too much

(i wanna tell him) 
i'm as human as the next girl 
i like a bit of flattery 
but i don't need your practised lines 
your school of charm mentality 
so save your breath for someone else 
and credit me with something more 
when it comes to men like you 
i know the score, i've heard it all before

(here comes the next one) 
blondie was with me for a summer 
he flirted like a maniac but i wouldn't bite 
i'm weak and he was so persistent 
he only had to have me 'cause i put up a fight

oh god, the boy had such an ego 
he liked to talk about himself all day and all night 
you think you're such a ladykiller 
but you were nothing special 'til you turned out the light

when he's nice to me, he's just nice to himself 
and he's watching his reflection 
i'm a five foot mirror for adoring himself 
here's seven years' bad luck

(i wanna tell him) 
when you say you love me 
you're just flattering your vanity 
but i don't need your practised lines
your school of charm mentality 
so save your breath for someone else 
and credit me with something more 
when it comes to men like you
i know the score, i've heard it all before

ooh, you're such a ladykiller
always on a winner, thinking that you're in there 
oh boy, you're such a ladykiller
super sexy mister, call it what you will, oh 
you think you're such a ladykiller
i just bet you're still there, posing in the mirror 
hey girls, he's such a ladykiller
but we know where he's coming from and we know the score
