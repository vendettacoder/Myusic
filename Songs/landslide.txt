i took my love, took it down
i climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'til the landslide brought me down

oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changing ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?

mmm, hmm, mmm

well, i've been afraid of changing
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder, even children get older
and i'm getting older too

well, i've been afraid of changing
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder, even children get older
and i'm getting older too
oh, i'm getting older too

oh, take my love, take it down
oh, climb a mountain and turn around
and if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
well, the landslide will bring it down
and if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
well, the landslide will bring it down
oh, oh, the landslide will bring you down
