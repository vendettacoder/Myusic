i see his thumbs workin? overtime lately
immersed in a text you sent discretely
she probably a cool chick, light skinned, pretty
come to think of it, she probably a lot like me

it's a low blow but i act like i don't know
you used to stay, now you say you gotta go
your excuses are very original
but you got no organizational skills

i get a text two seconds after you leave
obviously meant for her, not for me
it said, what's up, sexy? are you gonna come through?
let a brotha know what a sista gonna do

text me back, x x o o
i miss your embrace, sideways happy face
oops, did your thumbs have a nervous twitch?
you just sent the wrong text to the wrong bitch

lol, i text your celly
gotta spell out, go to hell
toss you in the trash
then reduce you to an acronym

wtf? you reply
i laugh so hard, i almost cry
beat you to the punch line
broke your heart before you broke mine

how you gonna go and tryna play me out?
why you gonna go and fill my head with doubt?
and clouds and shit, i don't wanna deal with
all stressed out shoutin, throwin' a fit, c'mon

how you gonna lie, you're way out of this one?
you think it might be time for a confession?
you've left no room for any more fabrication
boy a cell phone could be a dangerous weapon

next time check if the safety's on
trigger happy fingers can expose the gun
woah, what a tangled web you've spun
now it's on son, i'm about to have some fun

i make sure the i.d.'s unknown
i text you back from another phone
yeah baby, i'm comin? through
i'll meet you on the avenue

lol, i text your celly
gotta spell out, go to hell
toss you in the trash
then reduce you to an acronym

wtf? you reply
i laugh so hard, i almost cry
beat you to the punch line
broke your heart before you broke mine

lol, lol, lol
lol, lol, lol

i'ma kick back and watch shit go down
while you're standin' waitin' for her to come around
an hour goes by and still no sign
so you text her back, oh, one more time

where you at, girl? you said you was gonna meet me
this time you send the message correctly
she writes back, dawg, you blew up your spot
you're talkin' 'bout a text that i never got

who this girl you're talkin? to?
who this girl who comin? through?
you're messin? with somebody else
nigga, you just played yourself

lol, i text your celly
gotta spell out, go to hell
toss you in the trash
then reduce you to an acronym

wtf? you reply
i laugh so hard, i almost cry
beat you to the punch line
broke your heart before you broke mine
