your heart is a mess
oh, your head is a mess
oh, your house is a mess
and it's always a mess
oh, you're always like this
o, you're always a mess, now now

i'll be the first to admit
this is a bright but haunted age
i just don't know, now now
i just can't say, hey hey

when you get down
down to the heart and the bones of it
that's when it breaks you know
that's when it falls apart

but that's the price now
oh caveat emptor, open the atom's core
but that's the price now
oh caveat emptor, open your atom's core
oh caveat emptor, open the atom's core

oh oh, i just don't get it

and you keep slipping
down the surface of things
i just can't take it now
i just can't wait for more

when you get down
down to the subatomic part of it
that's when it breaks you know
that's when it falls apart
oh caveat emptor, open the atom's core

oh oh, i just don't get it
i just don't get it
get it
get it
get it
