i'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
i'm a runaway son of a nuclear a-bomb
i am the world's forgotten boy
the one who searches and destroys

honey, gotta help me please
somebody gotta save my soul
baby, detonate for me, oh

look out honey 'cause i'm using technology
ain't got time to make no apology
solar radiation in the dead of night
love in the middle of a firefight

honey, gotta strike a plan
somebody gotta save my soul
baby, penetrate my mind

i'm the world's forgotten boy
the one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
and honey, i'm the world's forgotten boy
the one who's searchin' only to destroy, hey

hey, hey
hey, hey

look out honey 'cause i'm using technology
ain't got time to make no apology
solar radiation in the dead of night
love in the middle of a firefight

honey, gotta strike a plan
somebody gotta save my soul
baby, penetrate my mind

i'm the world's forgotten boy
the one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy 
and honey, i'm the world's forgotten boy
the one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy

forgotten boy
forgotten boy
forgotten boy, i said hey
forgotten boy, i said yeah ah
hey, hey
