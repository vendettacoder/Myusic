i think my heart must be made of clay, 
'cause everyone said it would be broken some day, 
and now i've come to that fateful day, 
so i sit on the floor with my head in my hands, 

and don't tell me how to make it pay, 
i write a new song every day, 
i just wish i was made of wood, 
i might not feel pain, even if i should, 
 
even if i should, 
if i should 

the sweetest smile that ever did. 
melt the pats in the butter dish. 
and if you could have believed in me. 
i swear to god i'd have made damn sure. 

our hearts were warm, 
and glad with wine. 
i'd keep the doors locked all the time. 
i just wish i was made of wood. 
you might not seem glad. 
even if you should. 
 
even if you should 
if you should 
if you should 
if you should 

i think my heart must be made of clay. 
'cause everyone said it would be broken someday. 
seems like i have come to that fateful day. 
so i sit on the floor with my head in my hands 
with my head in my hands. 

if i should,
if i should,
if i should,
if i should
