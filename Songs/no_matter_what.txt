no matter what you are 
i will always be with you 
doesn't matter what you do, girl
ooh girl, with you

no matter what you do 
i will always be around 
won't you tell me what you found, girl
ooh girl, want you

knock down the old grey wall
be a part of it all 
nothing to see, nothing to say, nothing to do 
if you would give me all
as i would give it to you 
nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

no matter where you go 
there will always be a place 
can't you see it in my face, girl
ooh girl, want you

knock down the old grey wall
be a part of it all 
nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do 
if you would give me all
as i would give it to you 
nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be 

no matter what you are 
i will always be with you 
doesn't matter what you do, girl
ooh girl, with you 
ooh girl, you girl, want you 
ooh girl, you girl, want you
