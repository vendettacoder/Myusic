finished with my woman
'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think i'm insane
because i am frowning all the time

all day long i think of things
but nothing seems to satisfy
think i'll lose my mind
if i don't find something to pacify

can you help me occupy my brain?
oh yeah

i need someone to show me
the things in life that i can't find
i can't see the things that make true happiness
i must be blind

make a joke and i will sigh
and you will laugh and i will cry
happiness i cannot feel
and love to me is so unreal

and so as you hear these words
telling you now of my state
i tell you to enjoy life
i wish i could but it's too late
