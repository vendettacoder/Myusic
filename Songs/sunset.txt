oh look at the sun - it's all aglow
slow burning star - sinking low
heaven knows where you go
out of sight, out of minds eye, no
aw such a shame - you must leave
all day long you were a friend to me
still - the moon's company
until morning when larks will sing
horizon's appointment you'll keep
for sunswept flamingos must sleep
scenes like these from my dreams
cover cutting-room floors all over...

warm heart we spin slowly from view
why are you sad - do you disapprove?
how we've wasted our time
sunset - end of my day - my decline
postscript you trace colours the sky
red-letter light fades, is filed away
sunburst fingers you raise
one last sigh of farewell - goodbye
