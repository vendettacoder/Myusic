dig if you will the picture
of you and i engaged in a kiss
the sweat of your body covers me
can you, my darling, can you picture this?

dream if you can a courtyard
an ocean of violets in bloom
animals strike curious poses
they feel the heat, the heat between me and you

how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world so cold?
maybe i'm just too demanding
maybe i'm just like my father too bold
maybe you're just like my mother
she's never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like when doves cry

touch if you will my stomach
feel how it trembles inside
you've got the butterflies all tied up
don't make me chase you, even doves have pride

how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world so cold?
maybe i'm just too demanding
maybe i'm just like my father too bold
maybe you're just like my mother
she's never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like when doves cry
