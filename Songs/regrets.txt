stress
sunshine, geyeah

i sold it all from crack to o-pium, in third person
i don't wanna see em, so i'm rehearsin
with my peoples high to gm, from a remote lo-cation
in the bm, scopin the whole situation like, "dayamm!"
metamorphic, as the dope turns to cre-am
but one of these buyers got eyes like a korean
it's difficult to read em, the windows to his soul
are half closed, i put the key in
pulled off slow, hopin my people flee-in
chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
coppers was watchin us through nighttime binoculars
this time they got us on tape, exchangin dope for dollars
make me wanna, holler back at the crib in the sauna
prayin my people bailed out like time/warner
awaitin call, from his kin not the coroner
phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
how can i ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
this time... stress... givin this shit up... fuck

chorus 1:
this is the number one rule for your set
in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
on the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
this is the number one rule for your set
in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
and through our travels we get seperated, never forget
in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

as sure as this, earth is turning souls burning
in search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction
my moms cryin cause her insides are dyin
her son tryin her patience, keep her heart racin
a million beats a minute, i know i push you to your limit
but it's this game love, i'm caught up all in it
they make it so you can't prevent it, never give it
you gotta take it, can't fake it i keep it authentic
my hand got this pistol shakin, cause i sense danger
like camp crystal lake and
don't wanna shoot him, but i got him, trapped
within this infrared dot, bout to hot him and, hit rock bottom
no answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressin
my life found i got ta live for the right now
time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets

chorus 2:
you used to hold me, told me that i was the best
anything in this world i want i could posess
all that made me want is all that i could get
in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets... (when i was young)
(repeat x2)

i found myself reminiscin, remember this one
when he was here he was crazy nice with his son
i miss him, long as i'm livin he's livin through memories
he's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
in heaven lookin over me, or in hell, keepin it cozy
i'm comin life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
remember newton, mutual friend well me and him feudin
on your life i tried to talk to him
but you know niggaz, think they guns can stop foe niggaz
frontin like they're, big willie but really old niggaz
hoe niggaz, this year i'm sho' niggaz think i'm slippin
i'm bought to send you a roommate, no bullshittin
for my hustle's goin too well to hit him
you was right niggaz want you to be miserable wit em
anyway, i ain't tryin to hear it, i think i'm touched
this whole verse i been talkin to your spirit, a little too much

[chorus 1 x2]

roc-a, roc-a, roc-a, roc-a-fella y'all
