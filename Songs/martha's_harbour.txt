i sit by the harbour
the sea calls to me
i hide in the water
but l need to breathe

you are an ocean wave, my love
crashing at the bow
i am a galley slave, my love
if only i could find out the way
to sail you
maybe i'll just stow away

i've been run aground
so sad for a sailor
i felt safe and sound
but needed the danger

you are an ocean wave, my love
crashing at the bow
i am a galley slave, my love
if only i would find out the way
to sail you
maybe i'll just stow away

you are an ocean wave, my love
crashing at the bow
i am a galley slave, my love
if only i would find out the way
to sail you
maybe i'll just stow away

stow away
stow away
