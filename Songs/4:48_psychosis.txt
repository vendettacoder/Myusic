but you have friends 
what do you offer your friends to make them so supportive? 
what do you offer? 

100, 91, 84, 81, 72, 69, 58, 44, 37, 38, 42, 21, 28, 12, 7 

hatch opens 
stark light 

the television talks 
full of eyes 
the spirits of sight 

and now i am so afraid 

i'm seeing things 
i'm hearing things 
i don't know who i am 

tongue out 
thought stalled 

the piecemeal crumple of my mind 

where do i start? 
where do i stop? 
how do i stop? 
how do i stop? 
how do i stop? 
how do i stop? 

at 4:48 
when sanity visits 
for one hour and twelve minutes i am in my right mind 
when it has passed i shall be gone again 

remember the light and believe the light 
nothing matters more 

hatch opens 
stark light 

a table, two chairs and no window 

here am i (here i am) 
and there is my body 

dancing on glass 

in accident time where there are no accidents 

you have no choice 
the choice comes after 

cut out my tongue 
tear out my hair 
cut off my limbs 
but leave me my love 
i would rather have lost my legs 
pulled out my teeth 
gouged out my eyes 
than lost my love 

at 4:48 i shall sleep 

what do you offer? 

hatch opens 
stark light 

and nothing 
nothing 
see - nothing 

still black water 
as deep as forever 
as cold as the sky 
as still as my heart when your voice is gone 
i shall freeze in hell 

at 4:48 
(in) the happy hour 
when clarity visits 

warm darkness 
which soaks my eyes
