robert's got a quick hand
he'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
he's got a rolled cigarette
hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid

yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
in his dad's closet with a box of fun things 
and i don't even know what
but he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait

all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

daddy works a long day
he'll be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
and he's bringing me a surprise
'cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

i've waited for a long time
yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
i reason with my cigarette
and say, "your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits," yeah
