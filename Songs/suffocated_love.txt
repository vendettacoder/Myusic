it's too good
it's too nice
she makes me finish too quick
is it love?
no, not love
she turns my sexual trick
she says she's mine
i know she lies
first, i scream
then i cry
take a second of me
you beckon, i bleed
she suffocates me
she suffocates me with suggestion
i ask, do you feel the same?
and later on, maybe
i'll tell you my real name
she's so good
she's so bad
you understand
i can't stand
now i could just kill a man
she's on her knees
i say please
i cross her city lines
she's got brown eyes

i think ahead of you, i think instead of you
will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
i know why the caged bird sings, i know why 

forgive and you're forgiven
kingdom come
can you wait for yours
i need to taste some
life's really funny
i laugh while she spends my money
she's my freak
i guess i'm weak
you ask what is this?
mind your business
i pass idle days
with my idle ways
'til the twelfth of always
she roams my hallways
i keep her warm
but we never kiss
she cuts my slender wrists
let's waste some more time
i sign the dotted line
a different level
she-devil

i think ahead of you, i think instead of you
will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
i know why the caged bird sings, i know why

you ask what is this?
mind your business
i pass idle days
with my idle ways
'til the twelfth of always
she roams my hallways
i keep her warm
but we never kiss

she says i'm weak and immature
but it's cool
i know what money's for
push comes to shove
her tongue's her favourite weapon, attack
i slap her back, she mostly hates me

i think ahead of you, i think instead of you
will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
i know why the caged bird sings, i know why

can i take off your clothes
before we go out
and we'll lay helpless
and scream and shout
we finish everyday
well, anyway
sixty-nine degrees
my head's between your knees
you ask what is this?
mind your business

it's too good
it's too nice
she makes me finish too quick
is it love?
no, not love
she turns my sexual trick
she says she's mine
i know she lies
first, i scream
then i cry
take a second of me
you beckon, i bleed
take a second of me

i think ahead of you, i think instead of you
will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
i know why the caged bird sings, i know why
i know why the caged bird sings, i know why
