throw off those gimmicks to the boys
let them send it all up in the air
there is crouching and wailing on stones down here
we must freeze off this ratmosphere
scraping out noise across nite wires
runs - for the distant cities
there is never a lock in the fall down here
as the big full pours away

in the shutout
in the shutout
how will we know the great doll?

something attacked the earth last nite
with a kick that man habit - eye
cut the sleep tight boys who dreamed and dreamed
of a city like the sky
there were faces bobbing in the heat
for some rising from her zone
moving, hitting, holding on
for the promise to carry us home

in the shutout
in the shutout
never a lock in the fall
in the shutout
in the shutout
how will we know the great doll?
