my, my the clock in the sky is pounding away
there's so much to say
a face, a voice, an overdub has no choice
and it cannot rejoice

wanting to be, to hear and to see
crying to the sky

but the porpoise is laughing good-bye, good-bye
good-bye, good-bye, good-bye

clicks, clacks
riding the backs of giraffes for laughs is alright for a while
the ego sings of castles and kings and things
that go with a life of style

wanting to feel, to know what is real
living is a lie

but the porpoise is waiting good-bye, good-bye
good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
