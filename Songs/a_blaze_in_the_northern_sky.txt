hear a haunting chant
lying in the northern wind
as the sky turns black
clouds of melancholy
rape the beams
of a devoid dying sun
and the distant fog approaches

coven of forgotten delight
hear the pride of a northern storm
triumphant sight on a northern sky

where the days are dark
and night the same
moonlight drank the blood
of a thousand pagan men

it took ten times a hundred years
before the king on the northern throne
was brought tales of the crucified one

coven of renewed delight;
a thousand years have passed since then -
years of lost pride and lust

souls of blasphemy
hear a haunting chant

we are a blaze in the northern sky
the next thousand years are ours
