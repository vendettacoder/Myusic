i was writing his story and he gave me a look
he was very handsome, distractingly so
and i never dreamed that he'd be my boyfriend

he wrote me letters daily from prison
that said i know i've killed a few
but none of those women were you, i couldn't speak
it was over for me, i found my grim reaper prince

well, he said he loved me and he cooked me dinner
he cut my lungs out and made me feel thinner
and i'll never forget him now that it's over
the life that we had when they strapped him down

oh, but how all the girls were jealous
'cause he liked me the best
oh, and i couldn't breathe, it was true love indeed
but now my grim prince is gone

well, i said i loved him when they strapped him in
but he wasn't cryin' , he took it like a man
and the families watched him as he breathed his last
but i got rather angry, i started to laugh

and say now he's got what's comin', he was due his lot
oh and i couldn't see, there were tears on my cheek
goodbye, my grim reaper prince
goodbye, my grim reaper prince
goodbye, goodbye

i'll see you in a while, goodbye
fair well, goodluck
