the knife-sharpened tippie-toe
or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
you know, the one you never seen before

so if you ever meet the midnight rambler
coming down your marble hall
well, he's pouncing like a proud, black panther
well, you can say i, i told you so

well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler, yeah
you know, play it easy as you go
i'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

did you hear about the midnight rambler?
he'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
and did you hear about the midnight gambler
and did you see me make my midnight call?

and if you ever catch the midnight rambler
i'll steal your mistress from under your nose
i'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
i'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby, and it hurts
