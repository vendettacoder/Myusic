for all those who stood up and were counted
for all those for whom money was no motive
for all those for whom music was a message
i want to thank you
for making me
a little more sure
a little more wise
and courageous

you taught me to look much further
you taught me to want much more
you taught me the music matters
let's chase the dogs back from our door

i won't stop here
i won't be still 
until the sun sets
on us all

under the sheets with my radio
turned down low
so nobody know
it's the late night show
hopin' to hear "hey joe"
jimmy was my hero
head blown by type r
or was it a true star?
from bamalama
to tandamo
curtis mayfield
to kurtis blow
singin' into my pillow
and prayin' i don't dose
until my 9 volt battery goes
