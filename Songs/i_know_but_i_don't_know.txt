"hey, y'know?" - "uh, i dunno."

i know but i don't know.
i know but i don't know.
i know but i don't know.
i know but i don't know.

i give but i don't get.
i will but i won't yet.
i lose but i don't bet.
i'm your dog but not your pet.

now i know but i don't care.
then i know but i don't see.
now i see but i don't know.
i care but i don't care.

i could but i won't be.
you can but not with me.
it's all a mystery.
locked out without a key.

now i care but i don't care.
and i know but i don't see.
now i see but i don't know.
i know but i don't know.

now i know that you don't know.
and i see that you don't see.
i care but i don't care.
i don't care that you don't know.
