making your way in the world today
takes everything you've got
taking a break from all your worries
sure would help a lot
wouldn't you like to get away?

all those nights when you've got no lights
the check is in the mail
and your little angel
hung the cat up by its tail
and your third fiance didn't show

sometimes you want to go
where everybody knows your name
and they're always glad you came
you want to be where you can see
our troubles are all the same
you want to be where everybody knows your name

climbing the walls when no one calls
you've lost at love again
and the more you're down and out
the more you need a friend
when you long to hear a kind hello

roll out of bed, mr. coffee's dead
the morning's looking bright
and your shrink ran off to europe
and didn't even write
and your husband wants to be a girl

be glad there's one place in the world
where everybody knows your name
and they're always glad you came
you want to go where people know
people are all the same
you want to go where everybody knows your name

where everybody knows your name
and they're always glad you came
where everybody knows your name
and they're always glad you came
where everybody knows your name
and they're always glad you came
where everybody knows your name
