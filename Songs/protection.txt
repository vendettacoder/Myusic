this girl i know needs some shelter 
she don't believe anyone can help her 
she's doing so much harm, doing so much damage 
but you don't want to get involved, you tell her she can manage 
and you can't change the way she feels 
but you could put your arms around her 
i know you want to live yourself, but could you forgive yourself 
if you left her just the way, you found her 

i stand in front of you, i'll take the force of the blow, protection 
i stand in front of you, i'll take the force of the blow, protection 

you're a boy and i'm a girl 
but you know you can lean on me 
and i don't have no fear, i'll take on any man here 
who says that's not the way it should be 

i stand in front of you, i'll take the force of the blow, protection 
i stand in front of you, i'll take the force of the blow, protection 

she's a girl and you're a boy 
sometimes you look so small, look so small 
you've got a baby of your own when your baby's grown 
she'll be the one to catch you when you fall 

i stand in front of you, i'll take the force of the blow, protection 
i stand in front of you, i'll take the force of the blow, protection 
you're a girl and i'm a boy, you're a girl and i'm a boy, yeah
you're a girl and i'm a boy, you're a girl and i'm a boy, hey
