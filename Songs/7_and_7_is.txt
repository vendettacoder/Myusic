when i was a boy i thought about the times i'd be a man
i'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that i was in a can
in my lonely room i'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone
you can throw me if you wanna 'cause i'm a bone and i go
"oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah"

if i don't start cryin', it's because that i have got no eyes
my father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized
through a crack of light, i was unable to find my way
trapped inside a night but i'm a day and i go
"oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah"

one, two, three, four
