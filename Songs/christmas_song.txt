i need you more than the rain in 
springtime
love you more than the open sea
feel you most when i'm deep in madness

like the way you're always with me
i twisted things in a certain way
you understand my every weakness

i love you more than a thousand christmases
i want you more than any gift i can think of
i need you again and again

you should know i'm always watching
you're doing things in a different way
i feel you now cause i'm deep in madness

i love you more than a thousand christmases
i want you more than any gift i can think of
i need you again and again
