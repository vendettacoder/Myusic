well she said i know, but i just can't tell
everything that you've just been saying
lucy was there as well in the dark
when the kids in the band were playing

no one can hear a word or tell
what the girl was singing
see, she must've been 16 or 18
i'm just past caring

she was into the stones when
i was into the roses
she was breaking my bones when
i was busting their noses

she would tell me a secret
i would lose it the next day
young love pleases you easy
makes you sick in a bad way

and all the while the girls sang
la la la la and she sang
kickings for my sweetheart
bruises that i just don't miss
and she said "i can't love you any more than this!"

she said, she said, oh no no no no
then i get a yes why don't you kill me
i said when i'm messed up like this
sweetheart you know that don't thrill me

said i would've been there
if only i had been a little bit nicer
i was dead by sunday
half past skint just trying to please her

she was getting me pills when
i was into her best friend
she was chasing the thrills
and living down at the west end

she was pretty in braces
i lived under her window
she said, "take me to london"
tell me something i don't know

and all the while the girls sang
la la la la she sang
kickings for my sweetheart
bruises that i just don't miss
and she said, "i can't love you any more than this"

she was into the stones when
i was into the roses
she was breaking my bones when
i was busting their noses

she would tell me a secret
i would lose it the next day
young love pleases you easy
makes you sick in a bad way

and all the while the girls sang
la la la la she sang
kickings for my sweetheart
bruises that i just don't miss

and she said, "i don't like you
you can't stand me
i can't love you anymore than this"
