i will never forget your healing hands my love
i thought my heart had stopped
i swore i had given up
i will never forget your healing hands my love
you gave me daylight you gave me sunlight

turn the tape recorder on
he just left jackie o for marilyn monroe
we're all bought and sold
for tobacco, firearms and alcohol
what's a pocket full of gold
without a woman that you could hold
can't afford to be on the back burner no more
now i got a lot of places to go

cause the actions of a few
have put a world in harms way
and history has proven
that they killed our leaders dead
and i don't know about your right and wrong
i got a muse
from the east to the west
all i know is if i never said it before
i'm going to say it with my last breath

i will never forget your healing hands my love
i thought my heart had stopped
i swore i had given up
i will never forget your healing hands my love
you gave me daylight you gave me sunlight

find something you can sell
set you on a trail
have a ball and a belle
buy a ticket out of hell
not as far as i could tell

very well

bubba i'm a bust your tail
my uncle clarence hit
the hammer with nail
wash your hand before
you come to the meal
cut out the light
cause it comes with a bill

cause the violence of a few
have put a world in harms way
and history has proven that they
killed our leaders dead

well i don't know about your right and wrong
i got a muse from the east to the west
all i know is if i never said it before
i'm going to say it with my last breath

i will never forget your healing hands my love
i thought my heart had stopped
i swore i had given up
i will never forget your healing hands my love
you gave me daylight you gave me sunlight

i will never forget your healing hands my love
i thought my heart had stopped
i swore i had given up
i will never forget your healing hands my love
you gave me daylight you gave me twilight

never forget...
