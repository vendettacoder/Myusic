one day i left my room
in the evening
it was freezing
the sidewalk shining
but it was ok
i wasn't lonely
i wasn't no one
i was just hoping
for a bookstore
like the one i prayed for
and the music they play there
would be dinosaur jr
and the people who worked there
would be super skinny
and super unfriendly
and that would make me happy

what really kills me
is i'm only lonely
when i talk to you
yeah i should have told you
i just cant handle
your endless sorrow
all i wanted from you
was some tomorrow
but its ok
i'll find a bookstore
and buy saul bellow
&amp; one about old ruins
for my mother
you never met her
she liked manhattans
they taste like mouthwash
she understood how
to be alone
all alone
all alone

maybe the worst is over
maybe the worst is over
maybe the worst is over
maybe the worst is over

i left my room
one evening
the sun had just gone down
but the sky still shining
and not even the stars
up in heaven
could throw their ashes
on the blue still burning
over this ugly city

and that makes me happy
and that makes me happy
and that makes me happy
and that makes me happy
