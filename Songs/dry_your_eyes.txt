in one single moment, your whole life can turn 'round
i stand there for a minute, starin' straight into the ground
lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down
the world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown

please let me show you where we could only just be for us
i can change, and i can grow, or we could adjust
the wicked thing about us is we always have trust
we can even have an open relationship if you must

i look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
but her eyes glaze over, like she's lookin' straight through me
then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
when they open up she's lookin' down at her feet

dry your eyes mate
i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
there's plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but you've got to walk away now, it's over

so then i move my hand up from down by my side
it's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes
i turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh

'cause i can't imagine my life without you and me
there's things i can't imagine doin'
things i can't imagine seein'
it weren't supposed to be easy, surely
please, please, i'm begging, please

she brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
she wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
she peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
by pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers

dry your eyes mate
i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
there's plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but you've got to walk away now, it's over

and i'm just standin' there
i can't say a word
'cause everything is just gone
i've got nothin'
absolutely nothin'

tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperation
put my arms around her, tryin' to change what she's saying
pull my head level with hers so she might engage in
look in to her eyes to make her listen again

i'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' leave it all now
'cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow
and you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down
you're well out of order now, this is well out of town

she pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist
gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
turns around so she's now got her back to my face
takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away

dry your eyes mate
i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
there's plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but you've got to walk away now, it's over

i know in the past i've found it hard to say
tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight
but the more i pull on your hand and say
the more you pull away

dry your eyes mate
i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
there's plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but you've got to walk away now
