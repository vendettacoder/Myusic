this song goes out to all you fellas
who think your kisses are sweet as candy
but honey got you beat by a million miles

your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles
your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles

you came on in and took my love and ran away
leaving these eyes of mine crying every day
now you're back and are saying you want to stay
when you left you stayed too long
might as well keep moving on
and on and on and on and on

your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles
your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles

to you my whole life was nothing but a game
now you're here and don't want to take the blame
how could you use me,
call this time and ask me to feel the same
sorry for the tears you cried
there's another i won't lie, won't lie, won't lie...

your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles
your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles

yeah your kiss is sweet, hey sweet as candy
but honey beats your kisses by a million miles

beats them by a million miles
beats them by a million miles
