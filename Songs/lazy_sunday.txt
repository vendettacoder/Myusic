wouldn't it be nice, to get on with me neighbours
but they make it very clear, they've got no room for ravers
they stop me from groovin', they bang on me wall
they're doing me crust in, it's no good at all, ah!

lazy sunday afternoon
i've got no mind to worry
close my eyes and drift away
'ere we all are, sitting in a rainbow
gor blimey hello mrs jones, how's your bert's lumbago? (mustn't grumble)
i'll sing you a song with no words and no tune
to sing in your khazi while you suss out the moon, oh yeah!
lazy sunday afternoon
i've got no mind to worry
close my eyes and drift away
roo dee doo dee doo, roo dee doo dee die day
roo dee doo dee dum, roo dee doo dee doo dee
there's no-one to hear me, there's nothing to say
and no-one can stop me, from feeling this way, yeah
lazy sunday afternoon
i've got no mind to worry
close my eyes and drift away
lazy sunday afternoon
i've got no mind to worry
close my eyes and drift a-
close my mind and drift away
close my eyes and drift away
