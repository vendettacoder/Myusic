knocked on your door at dawn
with a spark in my heart
dragged you from your bed
and said let me see the colts

let me see the colts
that will run next year
show them to a gambling man
thinking of the future

have you been drinking no
nor sleeping
the all-seeing all-knowing eye is dog tired
and just wants to see the colts

we walked out through
the dew dappled brambles
and sat upon the fence
is there anything as still as sleeping horses
is there anything as still as sleeping horses
