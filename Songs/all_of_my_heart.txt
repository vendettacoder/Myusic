once upon a time when we were friends
i gave you my heart the story ends
no happy ever after now we're friends

wish upon a star if that might help
the stars collide if you decide
wish upon a star if that might help

what's it like to have loved and to lose her touch
what's it like to have loved and to lose that much

well i hope and i pray that maybe someday
you'll walk in the room with my heart
add and subtract but as a matter of fact
now that you're gone i still want you back

remembering
surrendering
remembering that part
all of my heart

spilling up in silk and coffee lace
you hook me up a rendez-vous at your place
your lipstick and your lipgloss seals my fate

sentimental powers might help you now
but skip the hearts and flowers skip the ivory towers
you'll be disappointed and i'll lose a friend

no i won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow
or that pleasure and pain sunshine and rain might make this love grow

but i hope and i pray that maybe someday
you'll walk in the room with my heart
add and subtract but as a matter of fact
now that you're gone i still want you back

remembering
surrendering
remembering that part
all of my heart

yes i hope and i pray that maybe someday
you'll walk in the room with my heart
and i shrug and i say that maybe today
you'll come home soon

surrendering
remembering
surrendering that heart
all of my heart
