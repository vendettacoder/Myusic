when i take the prisoners swimming
they have the time of their lives
i love to watch them floating

on their backs
unburden and relaxed

i sit in the tall grass and look the other way
and when i haul them in they always say
our sentences will not be served

we are constantly on trial
it's a way to be free

most nights i go for a drive
to the highest place i can find
standing on a cliff with goose flesh
watching the wind rip the leaves from the trees

death defying
every breath
death defying

soon we'll all be back in the yard
behind the walls living hard
dreaming of cool rivers and tall grass

we are constantly on trial
it's a way to be free

we are constantly on trial
it's a way to be free
