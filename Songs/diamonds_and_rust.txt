i'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
but that's not unusual
it's just that the moon is full
and you decided to call

and here i sit, hand on the telephone
hearing the voice i'd known
a couple of light years ago
heading straight for a fall

but we both know what memories can bring
they bring diamonds and rust
yes we both know what memories can bring
they bring diamonds and rust

now i see you standing all around and snow in your hair
now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over washington square
our breath comes on white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
speaking strictly for me, we both could've died then and there

now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
then give me another word for it
you were so good with words
and at keeping things vague

'cause i need some of that vagueness now
it's all come back too clearly
yes, i love you dearly
and if you're offering me diamonds and rust, i've already paid

but we both know what memories can bring
they bring diamonds and rust
yes we both know what memories can bring
they bring diamonds and rust

diamonds, diamonds and rust
diamonds, diamonds and rust
diamonds, diamonds and rust
don't want no more diamonds, diamonds and rust
