when i first saw you
something stirred within me
you were standing sutry in the rain
if i could've held you
i would've held you
rip it up and start again

rip it up and start again
rip it up and start again
i hope to god you're not as dumb as you make out
i hope to god
i hope to god
and i hope to god i'm not as numb as you make out
i hope to god
i hope to god

and when i next saw you
my heart reached out for you
but my arms stuck like glue to my sides
if i could've held you
i would've held you
but i'd choke rather than swallow my pride
rip it up and start again

rip it up and start again
rip it up and start again
i hope to god you're not as dumb as you make out
i hope to god
i hope to god
and i hope to god i'm not as numb as you make out
i hope to god
i hope to god

and there was times i'd take my pen
and feel obliged to start again
i do profess
that there are things in life
that one can't quite express
you know me i'm acting dumb-dumb
you know this scene is very humdrum
and my favourite song's entitled 'boredom'

rip it up and start again
i said rip it up and start again
i said rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and start again
