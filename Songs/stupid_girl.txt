i'm not talking about the kind of clothes she wears 
look at that stupid girl 
i'm not talking about the way she combs her hair 
look at that stupid girl 

the way she powders her nose 
her vanity shows and it shows 
she's the worst thing in this world 
well, look at that stupid girl 

i'm not talking about the way she digs for gold 
look at that stupid girl 
well, i'm talking about the way she grabs and holds 
look at that stupid girl 

the way she talks about someone else 
that she don't even know herself 
she's the sickest thing in this world 
well, look at that stupid girl 

well, i'm sick and tired 
and i really have my doubts 
i've tried and tried 
but it never really works out 

like a lady in waiting to a virgin queen 
look at that stupid girl 
she bitches 'bout things that she's never seen 
look at that stupid girl 

it doesn't matter if she dyes her hair 
or the color of the shoes she wears 
she's the worst thing in this world 
well, look at that stupid girl 

shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up 
shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up 
shut-up, shut-up, shut-up 

like a lady in waiting to a virgin queen 
look at that stupid girl 
she bitches 'bout things that she's never seen 
look at that stupid girl 

she purrs like a pussycat 
then she turns 'round and hisses back 
she's the sickest thing in this world 
look at that stupid girl
