hate, love and war
force emotions to the fore
but not for me of course, of course
i keep mine hidden

i keep mine hidden
but it's so easy for you
because you let yours flail
into public view

yellow and green, a stumbling block
i'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock
with a past where to be touched
meant to be mental

i keep mine hidden
the lies are so easy for you
because you let yours slide
into public view

(use your loaf!)
