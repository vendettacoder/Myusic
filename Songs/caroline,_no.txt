where did your long hair go?
where is the girl i used to know?
how could you lose that happy glow?
oh, caroline, no

who took that look away?
i remember how you used to say
you'd never change, but that's not true
oh, caroline, you

break my heart
i want to go and cry
it's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
oh, caroline, why

could i ever find in you again
things that made me love you so much then?
could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?
oh, caroline, no
