i'm a hungry planet
i had a youthful face
they were in a hurry
to go to outer space
they needed bombs and tungsten
ore and iron too
so they climbed and they dug and they blew
divided me right in two
i'm a hungry planet
orbiting in the sky
the things they did to hurt me
pass on by and by
now here i am all alone
they never ever learn
well i had to shake and quake
and make their houses burn
i'm a hungry planet
i had the bluest seas
oh the people kept choppin' down
all my finest trees
poisonin' my oxygen
diggin' into my skin
takin' more out of my good earth
than they'll ever put back in
i'm a hungry planet
