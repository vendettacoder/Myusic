all my bags are packed, i'm ready to go
i'm standing here outside your door
i hate to wake you up to say goodbye

but the dawn is breakin', it's early morn
taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
already i'm so lonesome i could cry

so kiss me and smile for me
tell me that you'll wait for me
hold me like you'll never let me go

i'm leavin' on a jet plane
i don't know when i'll be back again
oh babe, i hate to go

there's so many times i've let you down
so many times i've played around
i tell you now, they don't mean a thing

every place i go, i think of you
every song i sing, i sing for you
when i come back, i'll wear your wedding ring

so kiss me and smile for me
tell me that you'll wait for me
hold me like you'll never let me go

i'm leavin' on a jet plane
i don't know when i'll be back again
oh babe, i hate to go

now the time has come to leave you
one more time let me kiss you
then close your eyes, i'll be on my way

dream about the days to come
when i won't have to leave alone
about the time, i won't have to say

kiss me and smile for me
tell me that you'll wait for me
hold me like you'll never let me go

i'm leavin' on a jet plane
i don't know when i'll be back again
leavin' on a jet plane
i don't know when i'll be back again
leavin' on a jet plane
i don't know when i'll be back again
oh babe, i hate to go
