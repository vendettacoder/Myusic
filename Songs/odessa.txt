taking it slow, saving up she
before she know it, all i ask before she goes home
she's tired of cryin and sick of his lies
she's suffered him for far too many years of her life

feeling low, and scared that he'll say
do you know how over time you drove her away
saving up for, the day when she goes
the day that she stands up
for everything that she chose

(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say, who knows what she's gonna say?)
(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say, who knows what she's gonna say?)

saving up for, the day when she goes
the day that she stands up
for everything that she chose
taking the kids and driving away
turn around the life she let him siphon away

and i've been with you, for all of these years
tell me what i've got to show for all of my tears
the times you hurt me, and treated me wrong
something had to give to stop this thing from going on

(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say, who knows what she's gonna say?)
(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say)
(she can say, she can say, who knows what she's gonna say?)

she's tired of crying, and sick of his lies
she's suffered him for far too many years of her life
feeling low, and scared that he'll say
do you know how over time you drove her away
