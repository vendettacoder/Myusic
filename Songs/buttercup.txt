and i love to tie you up
and you love to let me down
we both try to cover it up
with a sound

you ate my buttercup
you ate my dinner too
i know that ain't a part of the deal
we're through, let me tell ya

it's just a matter of time
it's just a matter of time

and i love to share the cost
butterfly
reason why i need to fly, hide away
yeah

it's just a matter of time
it's just a matter of time
it's just a matter of time
it's just a matter of time

before we're thrown back in the wheel
before we're thrown back in the wheel

maybe i'll be hard pressed
maybe be we're both simple too
ain't a region on water

before we get back in the wheel
before we get back in the wheel
before we get back in the wheel
before we get back in the wheel
