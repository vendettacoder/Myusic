(note some words in 2nd line of chorus very indistinct)
(others invited to correct please - this is as close as i could get)

face to the wall 
and the universe is falling
i'm not ready
you make the call
and the last thing you were thinking of
was being a star... i don't know

writing the book of last pages
somewhere, all times 
meanwhile it all gets more real each day
from the unknown to the way home

like women at vow
you're devoted now to them
doesn't matter
when you get there, it's gone
it's another planet coming in space
backwards, too
guess i'm lost...

writing the book of last pages
somewhere, all times
meanwhile it all gets more real each day
from the unknown to the way home

instrumental chorus

this is the day
when we climb the fence around you
are you ready?
taking it on
you can see unfinished business everywhere
all the things you want to do
seems all right...

writing the book of last pages
somewhere, all times
meanwhile it all gets more real each day
from the unknown to the way home
writing the book of last pages
somewhere, all times
meanwhile it all gets more real each day
from the unknown to the way home
writing the book of last pages
somewhere, on times
