it used to seem so wonderful
to sit out in the breeze
until the town was overrun
by stinging killer bees
the stinging pests
were unwelcome guests
they had the town unnerved
'til the mayor imported vampire bats
and announced that dinner was served
on the edge of town
hanging upside down
from each limb of every tree
sway giant, dangerous vampire bats
with their bellies full of bees
but now they've got to find a way
to rid the town of bats
so, they're thinking of importing
hungry rabid mountain cats
