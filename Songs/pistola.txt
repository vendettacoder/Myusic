[chorus]
believe me when i tell you
i never meant to break your heart
may god pick up the pieces
of dreams that fall apart
forgive me and forget me
make a brand new start
don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
'cause i know, you know that, i know, you know that love is danger

[verse 1]
criminal minded, gangster of love
charms in your arms, your gun is wild warm
worn, bang bang, shoot 'em up
tips in your clip, click-clack, use 'em up
bad intentions and a very good shot
x marks the spot where you cross the heart
candlelight vigil on my memory block
commemorate the date where the bomb got dropped

love, steady war no more
put your weapon away, quit collecting the slain
she said "you're right, i don't wanna fight
i just like the fire and the flashing lights"

[chorus]
believe me when i tell you
i never meant to break your heart
may god pick up the pieces
of dreams that fall apart
forgive me and forget me
make a brand new start
don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
'cause i know, you know that, i know, you know that love is danger

[verse 2]
if you are to fall in love
then where should you stand to begin with?
and when the falling's done
how bad should you plan to get injured?
and if you land on your feet
do it count as a fall or a jump?
and do it feel like a fall
when the hands that pushed you were holding you up?

close encounter, got you wide open
heartache got your boombox going
music and vocals, lonely and soulful
your back in the scene where your sweet dreams are so true

[chorus]
believe me when i tell you
i never meant to break your heart
may god pick up the pieces
of dreams that fall apart
forgive me and forget me
make a brand new start
don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
'cause i know, you know that, i know, you know what love is

cowboys and girls, oh baby
i remember when we used to play
cowboys and girls, oh baby
i remember when we used to play
cowboys and girls, oh baby
i remember when we used to play

cowboys and girls
shoot 'em up, bang bang
cowboys and girls
shoot 'em up, bang bang
we at the movies, and you're a star
get down
