my girl is the queen of the savages
she don't know this modern world
and its ravages
instead of money she's
got yams and cabbages
she lives in a dome
i don't care if i never get home
my girl is the queen of the jungle folk
you should see the things
we see when we smoke
we think all of life is a funny joke
she's sharp as a tack
i don't care if i never get back
my girl is the queen of ten villages
we live on the fruits
of her pillages
she eats other queens
she's very religious
she doesn't use a fork
i don't think i'll go back to new york
