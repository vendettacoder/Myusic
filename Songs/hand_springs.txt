i took my girl to go bowling downtown at the red door,
after an argument, i started because i thought she didn't like me anymore.
i can't help it, sometimes i feel pitiful,
and of course, she's so young and beautiful.

i bought us two glasses of coke,
that's her favorite, and i wanted to make up for earlier,
but i dropped her glass and it broke,
so i just gave my glass to her.

she laughed and so did i in our lane,
then she went to the vending machine to buy a candy cane.
but right next to that was a boy i knew with a spring in his hand,
playing a country pinball machine called "stand by your man".
i saw him talk to her, but i stayed in my lane and played my game steady,
and was thinking of the day when i'd be too old to throw a ball this heavy.

but i guess i'm young now, so it's easy to knock 'em all down,
then i looked and saw her say to him "you're really hittin' that ball around",
and he's looking at her the way i did when i first met her,
i could see in his face white flowers, and cups of coffee, and love letters.

i was sorry to interrupt that game,
but i went and did it anyway.
i dropped my red bowling ball through the glass of the machine,
and said "are you quick enough to hit this ball, mr. clean?"
i was scared to lose her, so i couldn't help being mean.

and that ended both of our games,
i said i was sorry, but my girl left with him just the same.
i thought how much i hate when love makes me act this way,
i was bent over a broken pinball machine in a bowling alley and i threw it all away.

well, isn't it all just a big game?
