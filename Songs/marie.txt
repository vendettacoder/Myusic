i stood in line and left my name
took about six hours or so
well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
said they'd let me know
i put in my time till the pocono line
shut down two years ago
i was staying at the mission till i met marie
now i can't stay there no more

fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
to move some old cars around
maybe me and marie could find a burned-out
van and do a little settlin' down
aw, but i'm just dreamin', i ain't got no ride
and the junkyard's a pretty good ways
that job's about a half week old besides
it'd be gone now anyway

unemployment says i got no more checks
and they showed me to the hall
my brother died in georgia some time ago
i got no one left to call
summer wasn't bad below the bridge
a little short on food that's all
now i gotta get marie some kind of coat
we're headed down into fall

i used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but i got drunk and i woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and i ain't got it
it's my own fault i suppose

ah the pocono's down but the chesapeake's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was me i'd be headed south
but marie can't catch no train
she's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart i know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me

well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
i gotta stand in line again
i want to kill him but i just say no
i had enough of that line my friend
i head back to the bridge, it's getting kinda cold
i'm feelin' too low down to lie
i guess i'll just tell marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry

marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
i laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a chesapeake on the fly
marie will know i'm headed south
so's to meet me by and by

ah marie will know i'm headed south
so to meet me by and by
