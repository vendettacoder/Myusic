gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
gonna grab some afternoon delight
my motto's always been "when it's right, it's right."
why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

when everythings a little clearer in the light of day?
and we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?

thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
and the thought of loving you is getting so exciting

skyrockets in flight
afternoon delight
afternoon delight
afternoon delight

started out this morning feeling so polite
i always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite
but you got some bait a-waiting and i think i might
like nibblin' a little afternoon delight

skyrockets in flight
afternoon delight
afternoon delight
afternoon delight

be waiting for me, baby, when i come around
we can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down

thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
and the thought of loving you is getting so exciting

skyrockets in flight
afternoon delight
afternoon delight
afternoon delight

afternoon delight
afternoon delight
