here we stand
like an adam and an eve
waterfalls
the garden of eden
two fools in love
so beautiful and strong
the birds in the trees
are smiling upon them
from the age of the dinosaurs
cars have run on gasoline
where, where have they gone?
now, it's nothing but flowers

there was a factory
now, there are mountains and rivers
you got it, you got it
we caught a rattlesnake
now, we got something for dinner
we got it, we got it
there was a shopping mall
now, it's all covered with flowers
you've got it, you've got it
if this is paradise
i wish i had a lawnmower
you've got it, you've got it

years ago
i was an angry young man
i'd pretend
that i was a billboard
standing tall
by the side of the road
i fell in love
with a beautiful highway
this used to be real estate
now, it's only fields and trees
where, where is the town?
now, it's nothing but flowers

the highways and cars
were sacrificed for agriculture
i thought that we'd start over
but i guess i was wrong, hey

once there were parking lots
now, it's a peaceful oasis
you got it, you got it
this was a pizza hut
now, it's all covered with daisies
you got it, you got it
i miss the honky tonks
dairy queens and 7-elevens
you got it, you got it
and as things fell apart
nobody paid much attention
you got it, you got it

i dream of cherry pies
candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
you got it, you got it
we used to microwave
now, we just eat nuts and berries
you got it, you got it
this was a discount store
now, it's turned into a cornfield
you got it, you got it
don't leave me stranded here
i can't get used to this lifestyle
