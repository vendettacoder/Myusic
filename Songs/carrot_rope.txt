spiral:  i want to say:
sm:      it's my second hand wonder, 
a thing that recovers the doubt
spiral:  slim door,
mark:    like a rainstorm, you've got to do 
what you want and say it
sm:      it's of my design assembled at the cut
spiral:  slim door,
sm:      it's all right to shake, to fight, to feel
mark:    you go down, down, down, down
spiral:  slim door,
sm:      it's all right to shake, to fight, to feel
mark:    you go down, down, down, down

sm:    harness your hopes to the folks 
with the liquor with the ropes,
red, red ropes, periscopes
they've got everything will ever need 
stored under the chair

simmer, simmer, simmer down
simmer, simmer, simmer down
don't waste your precious breath 
explaining that you are worthwhile

simmer, simmer, simmer down
simmer, simmer, simmer down
be patient and i'll let you see my
carrot rope, feed my thrill, 
i got beat by weather
carrot rope, feed my thrill, 
i got beat by weather
carrot rope, feed my thrill,
it's time to get me off of the ground,
the wicket keeper is down
(the wicked keep us down?)

sm:    hey little boy, would you like to know 
what's in my pocket or not
it's no ploy, it's no gimmick,
it's the chance of a lifetime to see 
something that's never seen by mere mortals
mark:  except me
spiral:and myself
sm:    and sweet i, so what do you say?
would you like to play 20 questions with me?
sm:    a little, little christian lie,
a little, little christian lie
debating if it's time 
to drop the bomb on you, my dear
a little, little christian lie,
a little, little christian lie
let's get down to brass tacks and start it
a carrot rope, feed my thrill, 
i got beat by weather
a carrot rope, feed my thrill, 
i got beat by weather
carrot rope, feed my thrill
it's time to get me off of the grounds
the wicket keeper is down,
the wicked keeper is down
and he gets me off of the grounds
