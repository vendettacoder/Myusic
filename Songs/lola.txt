i met her in a club down in old soho
where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca-cola
c-o-l-a, cola
she walked up to me and she asked me to dance
i asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said lola
l-o-l-a, lola
la-la-la-la lola

well, i'm not the world's most physical guy
but when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine, oh my lola
la-la-la-la lola
well, i'm not dumb but i can't understand
why she walked like a woman but talked like a man, oh my lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

well, we drank champagne and danced all night
under electric candlelight
she picked me up and sat me on her knee
and said, "dear boy, won't you come home with me?"
well, i'm not the world's most passionate guy
but when i looked in her eyes, well i almost fell for my lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola
lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

i pushed her away
i walked to the door
i fell to the floor
i got down on my knees
then i looked at her and she at me

well, that's the way that i want it to stay
i'll always want it to be that way for my lola
la-la-la-la lola
girls will be boys and boys will be girls
it's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, except for lola
la-la-la-la lola

well, i left home just a week before
and i'd never ever kissed a woman before
but lola smiled and took me by the hand
and said, "dear boy, i'm gonna make you a man"

well, i'm not the world's most masculine man
but i know what i am and i'm glad i'm a man
and so is lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola

lola
la-la-la-la lola
la-la-la-la lola
