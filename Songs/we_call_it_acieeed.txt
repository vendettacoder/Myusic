acieed the musical phenomenon
only for the headstrong
makes you wanna dance
move your feet
keeps you in a trance
keeps you on your feet
we call it acid

acieed!
acieed!

you turn on 
you tune in, you drop out
acid has that effect
baseline pumping
body rocking
pulling the crowd hear them shout

acieed!
acieed!

acieed!

if you thought it was a drug
now you know you're wrong
you hear it in phuture, shoom, and spectrum
and we call it acid
