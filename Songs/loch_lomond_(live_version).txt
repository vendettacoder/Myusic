by yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes
where the sun shines bright on loch lomond
where me and my true love spent many happy days
on the bonnie bonnie banks of loch lomond.

t'was there that we parted in yon shady glen
on the steep sides of ben lomond
where in purple hue the highland hills we view
and the moon glints out in the gloaming.

you'll take the high road and i'll take the low road
and i'll be in scotland afore ye
where me and my true love will never meet again
on the bonnie bonnie banks of loch lomond.

where wild flowers spring and the wee birdies sing
on the steep steep side of ben lomond
but the broken heart it kens nae second spring
though resigned we may be while we're greetin'.

you'll take the high road and i'll take the low road
and i'll be in scotland afore ye
where me and my true love will never meet again
on the bonnie bonnie banks of loch lomond.
