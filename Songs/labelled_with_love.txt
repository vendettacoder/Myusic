she unscrews the top of her new whisky bottle
and shuffles around in her candle-lit hovel
like some kind of witch with blue fingers in mittens
she smells like the cat and the neighbours she sickens
the black and white t.v. has long seen a picture
the cross on the wall is a permanent fixture
the postman delivers the final reminders
she sells off her silver and poodles in china

drinks to remember i, me and myself
and winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
home is a love that i miss very much
so the past has been bottled and labelled with love

during the wartime, an american pilot
made every air raid a time of excitement
she moved to his prairie and married the texan
she learnt from a distance how love was a lesson
he became drinker and she became mother
she knew that one day she'd be one or the other
he ate himself older, drunk himself dizzy
proud of her features, she kept herself pretty

drinks to remember i, me and myself
and winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
home is a love that i miss very much
so the past has been bottled and labelled with love

he, like a cowboy, died drunk in a slumber
out on the porch in the middle of summer
she crossed the ocean back home to her family
but they had retired to roads that were sandy
she moved home alone without friends or relations
lived in a world full of age reservations
on moth-eaten armchairs, she'd say that she'd sod all
the friends who had left her to drink from the bottle

drinks to remember i, me and myself
and winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
home is a love that i miss very much
so the past has been bottled and labelled with love

drinks to remember i, me and myself
winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
home is a love that i miss very much
so the past has been bottled and labelled with love
the past has been bottled and labelled with love
the past has been bottled and labelled with love
