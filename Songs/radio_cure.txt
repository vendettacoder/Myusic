cheer up 
honey i hope you can
there is something wrong with me
my mind is filled with silvery stuff
honey kisses clouds of fluff
shoulders shrugging off

cheer up
honey i hope you can
there is something wrong with me
my mind is filled with radio cures
electronic surgical words

picking apples for the kings and queens 
of things i've never seen
oh, distance has no way of making love understandable

cheer up
honey i hope you can
there is something wrong with me
my mind is filled with silvery stuff
honey kisses clouds of fluff

picking apples for the kings and queens of things i've never seen
oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
oh, distance has no way of making love understandable

cheer up
honey i hope you can
