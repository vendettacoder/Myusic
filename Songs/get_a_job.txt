she throws the want ads right my way
and never fails to say

whoa, and when i get the paper
i read it through and through
and my girl never fails to say
if there is any work for me

and then i go back to the house
hear the woman's mouth
(preaching and a-crying
tell me that i'm lying about a job
that i never could find)
